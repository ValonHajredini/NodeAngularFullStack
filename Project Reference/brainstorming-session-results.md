## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 15 minutes

**Description:** Explored provocative scenarios to uncover architectural decisions and scaling considerations

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Load balancer implementation for 10,000 concurrent users across 500 tenants
2. JWT token structure with tenant ID for database query performance
3. Tenant unique URL implementation for routing optimization
4. Subdomain-based tenant routing as alternative architecture
5. Multi-tenant database strategy with isolation requirements

**Insights Discovered:**
- Scaling considerations should influence early architectural decisions
- JWT token design impacts both performance and security
- Multiple approaches exist for tenant routing (subdomain vs path-based)

**Notable Connections:**
- Performance and security considerations are interlinked in JWT design
- Tenant isolation strategy affects database, routing, and authentication layers

### Analogical Thinking - 10 minutes

**Description:** Used real-world analogies to discover implementation patterns and architectural insights

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Book marketplace model: Multiple publishers with own stores on shared platform
2. Facebook marketplace model: Seller and buyer accounts on shared infrastructure
3. Multi-tenancy as configurable feature (marketplace vs personal account models)
4. Environment variables for tenant feature toggles
5. System configuration table for database-level feature management
6. Flexible JWT structure that adapts based on operational mode

**Insights Discovered:**
- Real-world platforms solve similar isolation and routing challenges
- Multi-tenancy doesn't need to be "all or nothing" - can be optional
- Configuration-driven architecture enables multiple use cases

**Notable Connections:**
- Marketplace models translate directly to SaaS architecture patterns
- Environmental configuration mirrors real-world business model flexibility

### First Principles Thinking - 12 minutes

**Description:** Stripped away assumptions to identify fundamental requirements and dependencies

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Core foundation: Authentication system (JWT) + User context + Frontend↔Backend↔Database communication
2. Independent UI components (Tailwind/PrimeNG) that work regardless of auth
3. Feature modules that extend the core (PDF generation, drag-and-drop)
4. Minimum authentication flow: Register (name/email/password) + Login (email/password)
5. Public access patterns for unauthenticated use cases
6. Reusable UI components shared across applications
7. Pluggable architecture: Core + independent modules

**Insights Discovered:**
- Authentication is the foundational dependency for most features
- Some components are truly independent and should remain so
- Public access is essential even in "authenticated" systems
- Minimum viable authentication is simpler than initially assumed

**Notable Connections:**
- Core authentication layer enables all other dependent features
- Independent modules reduce complexity and increase reusability
- Public/private access patterns must coexist in the same system
