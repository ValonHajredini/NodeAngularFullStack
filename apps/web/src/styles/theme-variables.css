/**
 * Theme CSS Variables Stylesheet
 *
 * This stylesheet is a placeholder for theme utility classes.
 * When a theme is applied via ThemePreviewService, CSS variables are dynamically injected on :root.
 *
 * CSS Variables injected by ThemePreviewService:
 * - --theme-primary-color
 * - --theme-secondary-color
 * - --theme-bg-color
 * - --theme-text-primary
 * - --theme-text-secondary
 * - --theme-font-heading
 * - --theme-font-body
 * - --theme-field-radius
 * - --theme-field-spacing
 * - --theme-container-bg
 * - --theme-container-opacity
 *
 * ROLLBACK NOTE (Epic 23 - Story 23.1):
 * Removed incomplete utility classes from Epic 21/22 implementation.
 * Epic 21/22 utility classes were incomplete and only covered:
 * - Input fields (.theme-input)
 * - Buttons (.theme-button-primary, .theme-button-secondary)
 * - Typography (partial - .theme-heading, .theme-text-primary, .theme-text-secondary)
 * - Labels (.theme-label)
 * - Basic containers (.theme-container, .theme-background)
 *
 * Missing comprehensive coverage for:
 * - All background/container variants
 * - Form builder canvas elements
 * - Public form renderer elements
 * - Complete Tailwind CSS conflict resolution
 * - Accessibility states (focus, hover, disabled) across all elements
 *
 * These utility classes will be rebuilt correctly in Epic 23 Stories 23.3-23.6 with:
 * - Complete theme utility classes covering ALL form elements
 * - Proper Tailwind CSS conflict resolution
 * - Full background/container theming support
 * - Applied in form builder, public renderer, and preview contexts
