# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This Angular workspace is rooted at `apps/web`. Application source lives in `src/app` and follows a feature-first layout: reusable providers under `core`, cross-cutting UI in `shared`, and page flows in `features/*`. Layout templates reside in `src/app/layouts`, while global styling assets live in `src/styles` and `public/`. Generated builds land in `dist/`, with API documentation and design briefs in `docs/`. End-to-end scaffolding is kept in `tests/e2e`, ready for Playwright suites.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install dependencies with `npm install`. Use `npm run dev` (alias `npm start`) to serve the app locally with the configured proxy. `npm run build` creates an optimized bundle in `dist/`. Run `npm run lint` before committing to apply the Angular ESLint rules. `npm run test` executes Karma + Jasmine unit suites, `npm run test:coverage` writes coverage reports to `coverage/`, and `npm run typecheck` performs a strict TypeScript pass.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
TypeScript files use 2-space indentation, single quotes, and a 100-character width enforced by Prettier. Angular selectors must follow the configured prefixes: components use the `app-foo` element form and directives use `appFoo` attribute form. Avoid `any`, declare explicit return types, and prefer const/optional chaining per ESLint. Place shared pipes, directives, and utilities in `src/app/shared`, and keep feature-specific components inside their respective `features/{domain}` folders.

## Testing Guidelines
Name unit specs with the `.spec.ts` suffix beside the implementation file. Mock services through Angularâ€™s `TestBed` and ensure asynchronous flows await observables; the linter flags unhandled promises. Treat new behavior as coverage-increasing: verify `coverage/` retains or improves totals before merging. Playwright-based end-to-end scenarios should live under `tests/e2e/pages` once `playwright.config.ts` is introduced; stub fixtures in `tests/e2e/fixtures`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Prefer short, imperative commit messages similar to `Implement live field preview rendering`. Group related changes into a single commit and reference issue IDs when available. Pull requests should summarize scope, outline testing performed (`npm run test`, `npm run lint`, etc.), and attach screenshots or recordings for UI changes. Flag configuration updates (e.g., `proxy.conf.json`) and note any migration steps for reviewers.
