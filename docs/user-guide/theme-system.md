# Form Theme System User Guide

The Form Theme System allows you to apply pre-designed styling themes to your forms, giving them a
professional and polished appearance without any custom CSS knowledge.

## How to Use Themes

### 1. Open Form Builder

Navigate to the Form Builder from your dashboard or tools menu.

### 2. Access Theme Selection

Click the **"Styling Themes"** button in the toolbar to open the theme selection panel.

### 3. Browse Available Themes

The theme panel displays all available themes in a grid layout. Each theme shows:

- A preview thumbnail
- Theme name
- Brief description
- Usage count (how many times it's been applied)

### 4. Apply a Theme

Click on any theme thumbnail to instantly apply it to your form. The form canvas will update
immediately to show the new styling.

### 5. Save Your Form

After applying a theme, save your form to persist the theme selection. The theme will be applied to
both the form builder preview and the published form.

3. Refresh the page if the theme doesn't appear immediately

### Fonts Not Loading

2. Ensure your browser supports web fonts
3. Try refreshing the page

### Mobile Display Issues

2. If you see layout issues, check your form's field configuration
3. Test on actual mobile devices for best results

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I create custom themes?

Custom theme creation is currently an admin-only feature. Contact your administrator if you need a
custom theme for your organization.

### Do themes work on mobile devices?

Yes! All themes are fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices. The layout automatically
adapts to different screen sizes.

### What happens if I delete a theme?

If a theme is deleted, forms using that theme will gracefully fall back to the default styling. No
forms will break, but they'll lose the custom theme appearance.

### Can I use themes with custom backgrounds?

Absolutely! Themes provide the base styling (colors, fonts, borders), while custom backgrounds add
additional visual elements. They work together seamlessly.

### Are themes accessible?

Yes, all themes are designed with accessibility in mind, including proper color contrast ratios and
readable fonts.

### How do I change a theme after applying it?

Simply click the "Styling Themes" button again and select a different theme. The change will be
applied immediately to your form preview.
