# Architecture Design Decisions

## Overview

This document explains the key architectural decisions made in the NodeAngularFullStack boilerplate,
their rationale, trade-offs, and extension points for customization.

## Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Developer Experience First

**Decision:** Prioritize developer productivity and onboarding experience over premature
optimization.

**Rationale:**

- Reduces time-to-first-commit from days to hours
- Lowers barrier to entry for new team members
- Enables rapid prototyping and MVP development

**Trade-offs:**

- Some production optimizations deferred to deployment time
- Slightly larger initial codebase than minimal setups

**Extension Points:**

- Remove unused features via feature flags
- Add complexity gradually as needs evolve
- Customize development tools in `scripts/` directory

### 2. Monorepo with Service Boundaries

**Decision:** Single repository with clear service separations using npm workspaces.

**Rationale:**

- Simplifies dependency management and versioning
- Enables atomic commits across frontend/backend
- Supports shared TypeScript types without external packages
- Easier code review and testing coordination

**Trade-offs:**

- Larger repository size than separate repos
- Requires discipline to maintain service boundaries
- Build times increase with repository size

**Extension Points:**

- Extract services to separate repositories when team size justifies it
- Use workspace scripts for service-specific operations
- Implement linting rules to enforce boundaries

### 3. TypeScript Everywhere

**Decision:** Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend with shared types.

**Rationale:**

- Eliminates API contract drift between frontend/backend
- Provides compile-time safety for critical business logic
- Improves IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- Reduces runtime errors and debugging time

**Trade-offs:**

- Additional build step complexity
- Learning curve for JavaScript-only developers
- Slower development server startup

**Extension Points:**

- Add custom type generators for external APIs
- Implement runtime type validation with libraries like Zod
- Create domain-specific type utilities in `packages/shared`

## Frontend Architecture Decisions

### 4. Angular 20+ Standalone Components

**Decision:** Use standalone components instead of NgModules.

**Rationale:**

### 5. Feature-Based Organization

**Decision:** Organize code by business features rather than technical layers.

**Rationale:**

- Improves code locality and reduces context switching
- Enables feature ownership by development teams
- Simplifies code review and testing scope
- Supports lazy loading for performance

**Trade-offs:**

- Potential for code duplication across features
- Requires clear feature boundary definitions
- May complicate shared component organization

**Extension Points:**

2. **Database Scaling:** Implement read replicas and caching before considering sharding
3. **Microservice Migration:** Use service boundaries to extract services when team size justifies
   it
4. **Performance Optimization:** Profile before optimizing and measure impact of changes

### Technology Updates

1. **Framework Updates:** Follow semantic versioning and test thoroughly in staging
2. **Dependency Management:** Regular security updates and dependency auditing
3. **Architecture Evolution:** Gradual migration strategies for major architectural changes
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain API compatibility during transitions
