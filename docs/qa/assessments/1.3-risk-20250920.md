# Risk Assessment - Story 1.3: Express.js Backend Foundation
**Date:** 2025-09-20
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Risk Score:** 7/10 (High)

## Risk Escalation Triggers Met
- ✅ **Auth/Security Files**: JWT configuration, authentication middleware setup
- ✅ **Limited Test Coverage**: Integration tests had compilation errors, server functionality untested
- ✅ **Large Change Set**: Complete backend foundation implementation (>500 lines)
- ✅ **Complex Acceptance Criteria**: 7 acceptance criteria with cross-cutting concerns

## Risk Categories

### Technical Risk: **Medium (6/10)**
- **Database Architecture**: Using native pg driver instead of TypeORM/Prisma (acceptable deviation)
- **Test Coverage**: Significant gaps in core server and database service testing
- **Environment Configuration**: Resolved runtime crashes from missing environment variables

### Security Risk: **Low (4/10)**
- **Positive**: Comprehensive security middleware, proper JWT handling, parameterized queries
- **Concern**: Default development secrets (acceptable for development environment)

### Performance Risk: **Low (3/10)**
- **Positive**: Connection pooling, compression, monitoring implemented
- **Minimal concerns**: Well-architected for performance

### Operational Risk: **Medium (6/10)**
- **Concern**: Server lifecycle and error handling not fully tested
- **Positive**: Graceful shutdown, comprehensive logging, health checks implemented

## Mitigation Actions Taken
1. Fixed Jest/TypeScript compilation errors blocking test execution
2. Created test environment configuration to prevent runtime crashes
3. Added database service unit tests to improve coverage
4. Documented test coverage gaps for future improvement

## Residual Risks
- Server startup/shutdown procedures lack test coverage
- Middleware integration behavior not validated through tests
- Database connection failure scenarios not fully tested

## Recommendation
**CONCERNS** gate status appropriate - implementation is solid but test coverage improvements needed before production deployment.
