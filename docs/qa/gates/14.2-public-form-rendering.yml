# Quality Gate Decision: Story 14.2 - Public Form Rendering with Row Layout
schema: 1
story: "14.2"
story_title: "Public Form Rendering with Row Layout - Brownfield Enhancement"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is solid with comprehensive unit tests (100+ test cases), but missing E2E tests and CLAUDE.md documentation updates as required by ACs 11 and 13."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Critical gaps that prevent PASS gate
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Missing E2E tests for row layout rendering (AC #11 - Tests 1-4 not implemented)"
    suggested_action: "Implement 4 E2E tests covering: (1) row layout rendering with multi-field columns, (2) mobile responsive stacking, (3) backward compatibility with global layout, (4) form submission with row layout"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "CLAUDE.md not updated with row layout rendering description (AC #13)"
    suggested_action: "Add section to CLAUDE.md 'Form Builder Development' documenting public form row layout rendering, responsive behavior, and backward compatibility"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No cross-browser testing evidence (AC #12 - Test 5 not documented)"
    suggested_action: "Manually test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and document results (or add to E2E test suite with playwright multi-browser config)"
    suggested_owner: dev

# Risk Assessment
risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 2, low: 0 }
  highest_risk:
    id: "TEST-001"
    probability: high
    impact: high
    score: 9
    rationale: "Missing E2E tests mean no validation that row layout actually renders correctly in production environment with real form data"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Add E2E tests before merging to main (regression risk: breaking public form rendering for users)"
    monitor:
      - "Update documentation (can be addressed immediately after merge if needed)"

# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - component reads sanitized data from API (sanitization handled server-side per existing architecture)"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient implementation with no unnecessary re-renders. Uses native CSS Grid for layout. No computed signals added (uses methods only)"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling preserved from existing implementation. Graceful degradation to global layout when rowLayout undefined"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with comprehensive JSDoc comments. Well-structured methods. Backward compatible design"

# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptionally comprehensive unit test coverage (117 tests, 60+ for Story 14.2 specifically)"
    - "Clean component implementation following Angular 20+ patterns (standalone, no signals used unnecessarily)"
    - "Excellent JSDoc documentation on all new methods"
    - "Perfect backward compatibility implementation (graceful degradation)"
    - "Efficient CSS Grid implementation with proper responsive breakpoints"
    - "Multi-field column support fully implemented (orderInColumn sorting)"
    - "No code duplication - row and global layout sections share field rendering"
  concerns:
    - "Missing E2E tests for production validation (HIGH severity)"
    - "Missing CLAUDE.md documentation updates (MEDIUM severity)"
    - "No cross-browser testing documented (MEDIUM severity)"
  technical_debt:
    - "Consider extracting field rendering logic into separate component to reduce template duplication (nice-to-have, not blocking)"
