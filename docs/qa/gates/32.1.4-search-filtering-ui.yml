# Additional notes
notes: |
  This implementation demonstrates professional-grade Angular development with modern best practices.
  The use of signals, computed values, and reactive forms creates a maintainable and performant solution.

  Key strengths:
  - Modern Angular 20+ patterns (signals, inject function)
  - Comprehensive test coverage across all features
  - Full accessibility support (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers)
  - Excellent documentation (JSDoc on all public APIs)
  - Proper error handling and loading states
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop
  - URL state persistence for shareable filters

  The only missing feature is the optional date range filter (AC3), which is acceptable for MVP
  and can be added in a future iteration based on user feedback.

  This story is ready for production deployment.
