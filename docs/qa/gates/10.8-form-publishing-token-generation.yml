  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'JWT token generation secure with environment-configured secret. Ownership validation prevents unauthorized access. Schema validation prevents malicious configurations. Input validation comprehensive with XSS protection and SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Database queries optimized with indexing. Connection pooling properly implemented. Async operations for non-blocking I/O. Efficient payload sizes with compact JWT tokens.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes. Database connection management with proper cleanup in finally blocks. Transaction rollback capabilities. Graceful degradation with rate limiting placeholder.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent JSDoc documentation throughout. Clear separation of concerns (controller → service → repository). Shared types for consistency. Swagger/OpenAPI documentation complete. Test coverage enables safe refactoring.'

risk_details:
  - category: 'authentication_authorization'
    score: 2
    probability: 'low'
    impact: 'low'
    rationale: 'Ownership validation properly implemented. All endpoints require authentication. Authorization checks prevent unauthorized publishing.'
  - category: 'data_validation'
    score: 1
    probability: 'very-low'
    impact: 'low'
    rationale: 'Schema validation comprehensive. Duplicate field names detected. Regex patterns validated. Expiration days range validated. UUID validation in place.'
  - category: 'error_handling'
    score: 1
    probability: 'very-low'
    impact: 'low'
    rationale: 'Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes. Database errors caught and wrapped. Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 400, 500).'
  - category: 'security'
    score: 2
    probability: 'low'
    impact: 'low'
    rationale: 'JWT token generation secure. Secret configuration validated. Token expiration enforced. SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries. XSS protection middleware applied.'
  - category: 'performance'
    score: 1
    probability: 'very-low'
    impact: 'low'
    rationale: 'Database queries efficient. Connection pooling implemented. Async operations for non-blocking I/O. No N+1 query issues detected.'
