nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Signal-based state management prevents mutation vulnerabilities. Input validation on all methods."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Benchmark tests confirm <10ms computed signal, <50ms add/remove operations. Performance requirements AC 12 fully validated."

    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages. Backward compatibility preserved for forms without sub-columns."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation. Signal-based reactive patterns follow Angular 20+ best practices. Type safety with SubColumnConfigInternal pattern."

code_quality_highlights:
  - "SubColumnConfigInternal pattern elegantly adds rowId for internal state while preserving SubColumnConfig interface for serialization"

  - "Test coverage includes: happy path, error cases, edge cases, backward compatibility, performance benchmarks"
  - "Signal immutability strictly enforced with .update() and .set() methods - no direct mutations"
  - "Validation in setFieldPosition prevents invalid subColumnIndex values with clear error messages"
