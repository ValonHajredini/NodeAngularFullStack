# Risk assessment
risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 1, high: 6, medium: 2, low: 0 }
  highest: critical
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Complete Tasks 4-13 before marking story as 'Review' or 'Done'"
      - "Integrate modal into FormBuilderComponent (Task 13 is critical blocker)"
      - "Implement all wizard step functionality (Tasks 4-8)"
      - "Add theme save and preview capabilities (Tasks 9-10)"
    monitor:
      - "Ensure tests pass before final review"
      - "Verify responsive behavior on all devices"
