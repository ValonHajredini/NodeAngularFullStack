nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input validation with regex pattern /^\\d+fr$/ prevents injection. Confirmation dialogs protect against data loss. No auth or sensitive data concerns."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No automated performance tests for AC 14 requirements: UI render <100ms, toggle <50ms, dropdown <100ms, signal propagation <50ms. Component size (978 lines) may impact bundle and render performance at scale."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling implemented but untested. No validation of error scenarios: invalid row IDs, out-of-range column indices, service failures, edge cases in validation logic."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation and signal-based patterns, but 978-line component size, code duplication, and critical test debt (outdated tests create false confidence) impact maintainability."

  - "Sub-column controls hidden when row layout disabled"
  - "No breaking changes to existing form schemas"
  - "NOTE: Backward compatibility implemented but not tested"

architecture_patterns_followed:

  - "Standalone component architecture (no NgModules)"
  - "OnPush change detection strategy"
  - "Dependency injection for services (FormBuilderService, ConfirmationService)"
  - "Immutable state updates with signal.update() methods"
  - "Separation of concerns: UI state vs business logic"
  - "Proper validation and error handling"
