nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      EXCELLENT security implementation. DOMPurify configured with strict whitelist (p, h3-h6, strong, em, u, s, ul, ol, li, a, blockquote, br).
      Comprehensive XSS test suite covers 11 attack vectors: script tags, event handlers, javascript: URLs, iframes, objects, img onerror, style tags, SVG onload, base64 encoded scripts.
      Sanitization applied at TWO layers: FormBuilderService save AND FormRendererComponent render (defense in depth).
      Links forced to target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" (prevents tab-nabbing).
      Character limit enforcement (5000) prevents abuse.
      No H1-H2 allowed (accessibility/hierarchy compliance).
      CRITICAL: html-sanitizer.service.spec.ts has 27 passing security tests including multi-vector attack test.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Text truncation for preview (150 chars) prevents DOM bloat in builder canvas.
      Word counting (countWords) uses efficient regex split.
      Collapsible content with "Read more" for >500 words prevents excessive page height.
      DOMPurify is fast (runs in microseconds for typical content).
      No observed performance issues with long text blocks (<5000 chars).
      Plain text preview uses stripHtml() for instant rendering without HTML parsing overhead.
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Good: Default metadata values prevent undefined errors. Empty content handling (returns '' for null/undefined).
      Good: Collapse state tracked in Set (O(1) lookup, no memory leak).
      CONCERN: No error handling for DOMPurify failures (edge case but possible with malformed HTML).
      CONCERN: No validation for backgroundColor (could accept invalid hex values like "notacolor").
      CONCERN: No bounds checking for padding enum (could accept invalid values).
      Tests missing for these edge cases - runtime errors possible.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent code organization. HtmlSanitizerService is single-responsibility (sanitize, strip, truncate, count).
      TextBlockPreviewComponent is small (83 lines), focused, well-commented.
      Consistent pattern with HEADING and IMAGE field types (same architecture).
      TypeScript strict mode catches type errors at compile time.
      JSDoc comments present for all public methods.
      Code is self-documenting (clear variable names, small functions).
      Separation of concerns: sanitizer service is reusable across components.
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Heading hierarchy enforced (H3-H6 only, no H1-H2 to avoid page structure conflicts).
      Links have rel="noopener noreferrer" (security + accessibility).
      "Read more" button is keyboard accessible (native button element, not div).
      Text alignment options support WCAG (left/center/right/justify all valid).
      No ARIA required (semantic HTML used throughout).
      Screen readers will announce HTML content correctly (DOMPurify preserves semantic tags).
      Collapsible content has implicit aria-expanded behavior (native button).

test_architecture_notes: |
  STRONG: HtmlSanitizerService has exemplary security test coverage (27 tests including 11 XSS attack vectors).
  Pattern established for future field types: comprehensive unit tests for shared services, component tests for UI rendering.

  GAP: No component-level tests for TEXT_BLOCK integration. This follows same pattern as HEADING (15.1) and IMAGE (15.2) which also lack component tests.
  Recommendation: Create TEXT_BLOCK test suite as template for future field types. Include:
    - Component rendering (TextBlockPreviewComponent)
    - User interaction (field properties panel)
    - Public rendering (FormRendererComponent)
    - End-to-end workflow (integration test)

  Test pyramid observation: Service layer well-tested (base), component layer untested (middle), E2E missing (top).
  Action: Address inverted pyramid before adding more field types.

code_quality_highlights:
  - 'DOMPurify integration is textbook example of XSS prevention - strict whitelist, double sanitization, security attributes forced on links'
  - 'HtmlSanitizerService is highly reusable - stripHtml, truncate, countWords, isContentLong methods serve multiple use cases'
  - 'TextBlockPreviewComponent uses OnPush change detection for performance (no unnecessary re-renders)'
  - 'Consistent with existing HEADING and IMAGE patterns - developers can learn from similar code'
  - 'TypeScript strict mode + interfaces prevent runtime type errors'
  - 'Separation of concerns: sanitization service, preview component, renderer component all decoupled'

code_quality_improvements_needed:
  - 'Add backgroundColor validation (hex format regex or PrimeNG ColorPicker validation)'
  - 'Add bounds checking for padding enum (TypeScript union type validates at compile time, but runtime safety adds defense)'
  - 'Consider extracting TEXT_BLOCK constants (MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH=150, WORD_LIMIT=500, CHAR_LIMIT=5000) to shared config'
  - 'FormRendererComponent collapsedTextBlocks Set should be cleared on component destroy (potential memory leak if user navigates away)'

summary: |
  Story 15.3 delivers a security-conscious TEXT_BLOCK field type with excellent XSS prevention.

  STRENGTHS:
  - DOMPurify integration is exemplary (strict whitelist, comprehensive tests)
  - Defense-in-depth: sanitization at save AND render layers
  - 27 unit tests for HtmlSanitizerService including 11 XSS attack vectors
  - Consistent architecture with HEADING (15.1) and IMAGE (15.2)
  - Accessibility compliant (heading hierarchy, link security attributes)
  - Performance optimized (truncation, collapsible content)

  WEAKNESSES:
  - Component-level tests missing (TextBlockPreviewComponent, FormRendererComponent TEXT_BLOCK logic)
  - Integration test missing (TEXT_BLOCK excluded from submissions)
  - Edge case validation missing (backgroundColor hex format, padding enum bounds)
  - No E2E test for complete workflow

  GATE DECISION: CONCERNS
  Rationale: Security foundation is EXCELLENT (DOMPurify + comprehensive tests). However, component integration tests are missing, creating regression risk during future refactoring. This mirrors the pattern from 15.2 (CONCERNS) and 15.1 (likely similar gaps). Before production deployment, add component tests to validate UI rendering and user interaction.

  RECOMMENDATION: Add 3 immediate tests (P1 priority):
  1. TextBlockPreviewComponent unit tests (rendering, metadata, truncation)
  2. FormRendererComponent TEXT_BLOCK unit tests (sanitization integration, collapse logic)
  3. Integration test (verify TEXT_BLOCK excluded from form submissions)

  After these tests pass, gate can be upgraded to PASS.
