  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Code duplication (95% similarity) across 5 components will increase maintenance burden. Intentional per story requirements but should be refactored in future sprint."

notes: |
  Outstanding implementation quality with exemplary accessibility compliance.

  Code duplication is intentional per story requirements ("All new components MUST follow this exact pattern for consistency") and should not block deployment.

  The technical debt has been properly identified, quantified, and documented for future refactoring.

  All 5 chart components are ready for integration in Story 17.3.

  Special commendation for the comprehensive accessibility implementation - this sets a high standard for future component development.
