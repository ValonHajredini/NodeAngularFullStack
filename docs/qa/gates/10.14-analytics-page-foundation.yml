      ✓ Efficient rendering with @for tracking
      ⚠ Could benefit from virtual scrolling for very large datasets
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✓ Comprehensive error states (loading, error, empty)
      ✓ Graceful degradation when tool config fails
      ✓ Proper null/undefined handling
      ✓ Type-safe with TypeScript strict mode
      ✓ Observable error handling with catchError
