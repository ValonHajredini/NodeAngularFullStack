notes: |
  CRITICAL GATE FAILURE - Production Blockers Identified:

  Initial Review (CONCERNS):
  - Unit tests passed, code quality acceptable
  - Type safety issues fixed during QA review
  - E2E tests never executed (concerning but not blocking)

  Post-User Testing (FAIL - GATE STATUS CHANGED):
  User reported TWO CRITICAL production blockers:

  BLOCKER #1: Cannot add fields from palette to row layout
  - Root cause: Missing cdkDropListGroup connection between palette and row drop zones
  - Impact: Form builder completely unusable when row layout enabled
  - AC #3, #4 FAILED

  BLOCKER #2: Row layout not rendered in preview/published forms
  - Root cause: FormRendererComponent has NO row layout implementation
  - Impact: All forms display as single column regardless of configuration
  - AC #6, #7 FAILED

  Why Blockers Weren't Caught:
  - Unit tests passed but only tested isolated methods
  - E2E tests written but NEVER EXECUTED (claimed complete but no evidence)
  - No manual QA performed before marking "Ready for Review"
  - No integration testing between FormCanvasComponent and FormRendererComponent

  Quality Score Revised: 80 â†’ 30 (production blockers discovered)

  QA Recommendation - REVISED:
  - Gate status: FAIL (changed from CONCERNS after user testing)
  - Feature must be fixed before deployment - non-functional in production
  - E2E testing is MANDATORY for UI features - this proves why
  - Story must return to development for blocker fixes
