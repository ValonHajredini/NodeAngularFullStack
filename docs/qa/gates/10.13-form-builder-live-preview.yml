# Requirements Traceability Matrix
# All 12 Acceptance Criteria mapped to implementation and tests:
#
# AC1: Preview button opens new tab
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:847-927 (onPreview method)
#   Test: form-builder.component.spec.ts:253-315 (preview URL and window.open)
#
# AC2: Preview URL format /forms/preview/:previewId with UUID
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:849 (crypto.randomUUID())
#   Implementation: app.routes.ts:23-29 (preview route definition)
#   Test: form-builder.component.spec.ts:311 (URL format validation)
#
# AC3: Preview displays current form state from FormBuilderService
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:869-904 (previewData construction)
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.ts:102-144 (loadPreviewData method)
#   Test: form-renderer.component.spec.ts:664-722 (preview data loading)
#
# AC4: Preview mode banner displays
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.html:96-106 (preview banner)
#   Visual: Yellow background, info icon, "PREVIEW MODE" text
#   Test: Visual inspection required (template-based)
#
# AC5: Preview reuses FormRendererComponent with isPreview flag
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.ts:59 (isPreview property)
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.ts:84-96 (route detection)
#   Test: form-renderer.component.spec.ts:664-722 (preview mode detection)
#
# AC6: Preview data stored in localStorage with key form-preview-{previewId}
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:908-914 (localStorage.setItem)
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.ts:109 (localStorage.getItem)
#   Test: form-builder.component.spec.ts:292 (localStorage key validation)
#   Note: Changed from sessionStorage to localStorage to enable cross-tab preview
#
# AC7: Preview button enabled for published and unpublished forms
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:154 (no disabled condition on preview button)
#   Visual: Preview button always enabled in toolbar
#
# AC8: Submit button disabled in preview mode
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.ts:433-435 (canSubmit getter)
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.html:299-314 (conditional submit button)
#   Test: form-renderer.component.spec.ts:777-820 (submit disabled in preview)
#
# AC9: No popup blocker warnings (window.open in click handler)
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:926 (window.open called synchronously)
#   Best Practice: window.open executed directly in click event, not async
#
# AC10: Preview data auto-cleans (localStorage with 5-minute expiration)
#   Implementation: form-builder.component.ts:917-922 (setTimeout cleanup)
#   Implementation: form-renderer.component.ts:122-129 (expiration check)
#   Note: Changed from sessionStorage to localStorage with manual cleanup
#
# AC11: Existing form publish/render workflow unchanged
#   Verification: No changes to publish logic in forms.controller.ts
#   Verification: FormRendererComponent preserves published form rendering
#   Test: Existing form rendering tests still pass (regression check)
#
# AC12: TypeScript strict mode passes, no new ESLint warnings
#   Verification: npm --workspace=apps/web run typecheck (passes)
#   Note: Pre-existing lint warnings exist but unrelated to this story

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Preview data is client-side only, no authentication bypass. Preview mode correctly disables submission. UUID-based preview IDs are unguessable."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Preview is instant (no API calls). localStorage operations are synchronous and fast. 5-minute cleanup prevents memory leaks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling for missing/expired preview data. Expiration check prevents stale previews. Fallback error messages guide users."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code reusing FormRendererComponent. Well-documented preview logic. TypeScript strict mode enabled. Good separation of concerns."

# Code Quality Assessment Notes:
#
# Strengths:
# - Clean implementation following Angular best practices
# - Excellent reuse of existing FormRendererComponent
# - Comprehensive preview tests (9 test cases)
# - TypeScript strict mode compliance
# - Good error handling for missing/expired preview data
# - Proper separation of concerns (builder vs renderer)
# - Background settings properly propagated to preview
#
# Architecture Decisions:
# - localStorage vs sessionStorage: Changed to localStorage to enable cross-tab preview
# - Manual cleanup: 5-minute setTimeout for preview data expiration
# - Route structure: /forms/preview/:previewId separate from /forms/render/:token
# - Preview mode flag: isPreview boolean for conditional rendering
#
# Test Coverage:
# - Preview button creates localStorage entry with correct structure
# - Preview URL format validation
# - Preview data loading from localStorage
# - Missing preview data error handling
# - Invalid JSON error handling
# - Submit button disabled in preview mode
# - Form submission blocked in preview mode
# - Expired preview data cleanup
# - Empty optional fields handling
#
# Pre-existing Issues (unrelated to this story):
# - 1965 lint warnings/errors exist in broader codebase
# - Test infrastructure issues in main-layout.component.spec.ts
# - These are project-wide issues not introduced by this story
