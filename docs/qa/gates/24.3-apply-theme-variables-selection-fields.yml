# Story 24.3: Apply Theme Variables to Selection Fields

schema: 1
story: "24.3"
story_title: "Apply Theme Variables to Selection Fields (SELECT, RADIO, CHECKBOX)"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation complete with good CSS architecture, but lacks critical test coverage (zero unit tests, no E2E tests) and documentation. Functional verification only via manual testing."

    severity: medium

      - "Monitor for regression in theme variable inheritance"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CSS-only changes with proper theme variable fallbacks. No XSS risk. Uses existing sanitization."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CSS transitions properly configured (<200ms). No performance regressions expected. Theme variable inheritance efficient."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Lack of automated tests creates risk of regressions during future theme system changes. Manual testing only."

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Code quality good (DRY, consistent patterns), but missing JSDoc documentation violates project coding standards. Test debt hinders future refactoring."
