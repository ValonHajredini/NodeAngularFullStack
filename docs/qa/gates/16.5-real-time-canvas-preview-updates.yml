notes: |
  **Summary:**
  The real-time canvas preview feature is architecturally sound with excellent code quality:
  - Signal-based reactivity for instant updates
  - Proper separation of instant vs debounced updates
  - OnPush change detection strategy
  - Clean RxJS patterns (debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, takeUntil)

  However, CRITICAL test coverage gaps prevent a PASS gate:
  1. Missing test file: field-preview-renderer.component.spec.ts
  2. No tests for Story 16.5 specific methods in existing test files
  3. No performance tests to verify AC 8 and AC 10

  **Positive Findings:**
  - All 10 acceptance criteria implemented correctly
  - No security concerns identified
  - Good maintainability and code quality
  - Proper use of Angular 20+ patterns

  **CONCERNS Gate Reason:**
  Test coverage gaps are blocking production readiness. The implementation itself is solid.

  **Estimated Effort to Address:**
  4-6 hours to create missing tests and verify performance requirements.

  **Next Steps:**
  1. Create field-preview-renderer.component.spec.ts (2-3 hours)
  2. Add Story 16.5 tests to existing test files (2-4 hours)
  3. Add performance tests (2-3 hours)
  4. Re-review to verify all tests pass and performance meets requirements

  Once tests are added and passing, this feature should be production-ready.

risk_profile:

  # Test coverage gaps create risk, but implementation quality is high

  by_category:
    security: LOW
    performance: MEDIUM
    reliability: MEDIUM
    maintainability: LOW
    testability: HIGH

  mitigations:
    - 'Add comprehensive test suite (addresses testability, reliability, performance risks)'
    - 'Add performance benchmarks (addresses performance risk)'
    - 'Add error handling (addresses reliability risk)'
