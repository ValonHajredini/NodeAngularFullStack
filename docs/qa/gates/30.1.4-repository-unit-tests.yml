# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SQL injection prevention properly tested with parameterized queries. No sensitive data leakage in error messages."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Connection pooling properly managed. Fast test execution (1.3s for 39 tests). No N+1 patterns."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Client connections always released via try/finally blocks. No connection leaks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation. Clear separation of concerns. Type safety via TypeScript and shared types."

# Test architecture assessment
test_architecture:
  test_levels:
    unit_tests: "39 test cases with proper mocking of database layer"
    integration_tests: "Deferred to Epic 30.2 (as documented)"
    e2e_tests: "N/A for repository layer"
  test_design_quality:
    pattern: "AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) consistently applied"
    naming: "Descriptive test names documenting behavior"
    organization: "Nested describe blocks for logical grouping"
  edge_coverage:
    - "Null optional fields (lines 614-635)"
    - "Empty result arrays (lines 637-647)"
    - "SQL injection prevention (lines 599-611)"
    - "Special characters in search (lines 649-656)"
    - "Database error scenarios (duplicate keys, not found, connection failures)"
    - "Dynamic SET clause combinations (update method)"
  mock_strategy: "Proper isolation with Jest mocks for pg.Pool and PoolClient"

# Recommendations (future enhancements, not blocking)
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding integration tests in Epic 30.2 to verify actual database queries"
      refs: ["apps/api/tests/integration/"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Unit tests provide excellent coverage. Integration tests would validate end-to-end database behavior."

# Code quality highlights
strengths:
  - "96% test coverage exceeds 90% requirement"
  - "100% function coverage - all repository methods tested"
  - "98.18% branch coverage - comprehensive conditional logic testing"
  - "SQL injection prevention properly verified"
  - "Connection pooling correctly managed (client.release in finally blocks)"
  - "Repository pattern with single responsibility principle"
  - "Type safety via shared types package"
  - "Excellent JSDoc documentation with usage examples"

# Minor observations (not blocking)
observations:
  - note: "5 uncovered lines (140, 297, 321, 346, 376) in generic catch blocks"
    severity: "low"
    impact: "Represents ~4% of code. Generic error paths already covered by specific error tests."

# Decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story demonstrates gold standard repository testing with comprehensive coverage,
  proper abstraction, and production-ready quality. All acceptance criteria are fully
  satisfied:

  ✅ AC1: Unit tests for all 9 repository methods (39 test cases)
  ✅ AC2: 96% coverage exceeds 90% requirement
  ✅ AC3: Proper mocking with no real database connections
  ✅ AC4: Comprehensive edge case testing (nulls, empty arrays, SQL injection, special chars)
  ✅ AC5: All 39 tests pass (100% pass rate)

  Security, performance, reliability, and maintainability NFRs all pass with no concerns.
  No refactoring required. Ready for production deployment.
