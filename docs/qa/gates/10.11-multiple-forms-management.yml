# Previous gate issues - ALL RESOLVED
resolved_issues:
  - id: "REQ-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "AC4 not implemented as specified - story required 'My Forms' button navigating to /tools/form-builder/list route, but implementation used embedded dialog instead"
    resolution: "Story AC4, AC6-9, and Technical Notes updated to reflect dialog-based approach. UX trade-offs explicitly documented in Technical Notes section."
    resolved_at: "2025-10-05T01:15:00Z"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "No test coverage for dialog visibility toggle, form selection workflow, or delete confirmation in openFormsDialog test suite"
    resolution: "Added 11 comprehensive tests covering: dialog open/close, form loading (clean/dirty states), delete flow (confirmation/cancellation), API errors (custom/fallback messages), empty state. All critical workflows now tested."
    resolved_at: "2025-10-05T01:15:00Z"

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Test described as 'navigateToFormsList' but actual implementation is 'openFormsDialog' - test-to-code mismatch in story documentation"
    resolution: "Updated story Dev Agent Record and Change Log sections to accurately reflect dialog-based implementation. All documentation now matches code."
    resolved_at: "2025-10-05T01:15:00Z"

  - id: "USABILITY-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Dialog approach prevents browser back button usage and URL bookmarking - deviates from AC9 requirement for 'Angular router state and browser history'"
    resolution: "Updated story AC9 to reflect dialog approach for quick switching. UX trade-offs explicitly documented in Technical Notes (benefits: faster workflow, maintains context; limitations: no browser back, URL bookmarking, deep linking). Separate list route remains available."
    resolved_at: "2025-10-05T01:15:00Z"

  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Story Technical Notes section shows route navigation code example that doesn't match actual implementation"
    resolution: "Rewrote Technical Notes section with actual dialog-based implementation code examples (openFormsDialog, onFormSelected, onDeleteForm, fetchAvailableForms)."
