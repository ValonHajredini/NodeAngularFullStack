        Created dedicated test suite with comprehensive AC 10 coverage:
        1. ✅ Test duplicate button renders with pi-copy icon and correct aria-label
        2. ✅ Test click handler calls formBuilderService.duplicateRow(rowId) with correct ID
        3. ✅ Test button disabled when formBuilderService.isPublished() returns true
        4. ✅ Test UI updates reactively after duplication (new row appears in list)
        5. ✅ Test aria-label="Duplicate row {order + 1}" for WCAG AA accessibility compliance
        6. ✅ Test success console logging behavior
        7. ✅ Test error console logging behavior
