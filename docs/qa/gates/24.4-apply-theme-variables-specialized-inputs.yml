# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security vulnerabilities. CSS variables safely scoped. ARIA attributes properly escaped. No XSS vectors."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "OnPush change detection used. Theme application < 50ms. CSS transitions use GPU-accelerated properties. No memory leaks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fallback values provided for all CSS variables. Graceful degradation when theme variables undefined. Browser-specific styling handled."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JSDoc comments present. Consistent naming conventions. Clear separation between preview and public form styling. DRY principle followed."
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "WCAG AA compliance with 44px touch targets on mobile. ARIA labels and required attributes properly implemented. Keyboard focus states use theme primary color."
