# Code Changes During Review
refactoring_performed:
  - file: "apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/field-palette/field-palette.component.spec.ts"
    change: "Added FormFieldType import and updated test to use enum instead of string literal"
    reason: "TypeScript compilation failing due to incorrect type usage"
  - file: "apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/field-properties/field-properties.component.spec.ts"
    change: "Added FormFieldType import and completed test field objects with all required properties"
    reason: "Test data was incomplete and didn't match production FormField interface"
  - file: "apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/form-canvas.component.spec.ts"
    change: "Added FormFieldType import and completed test field objects"
    reason: "Same as above - realistic test data validation"
  - file: "apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts"
    change: "Fixed PrimeNG imports - replaced Button/Dialog/InputText/Select with ButtonDirective, kept Toast"
    reason: "Angular NG8113 warnings - unused component imports in template (uses pButton directive instead)"
  - file: "apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/field-properties/field-properties.component.ts"
    change: "Replaced InputText with InputTextModule, Textarea with TextareaModule, Button with ButtonDirective"

  - file: "apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-settings/form-settings.component.ts"
    change: "Replaced InputText with InputTextModule, Textarea with TextareaModule, Button with ButtonDirective"
