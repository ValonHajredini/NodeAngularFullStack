# Quality Gate Decision - Story 30.1.1
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)
# This gate file provides a comprehensive quality assessment for the tool registry database schema implementation.

# ============ Required Fields ============
schema: 1
story: "30.1.1"
story_title: "Tool Registry Database Schema"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage. Implementation follows all project standards with excellent documentation. No issues identified. This is a model implementation for future database migrations."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# ============ Extended Quality Metrics ============

quality_score: 100  # 100 - (20*FAILs) - (10*CONCERNS) = 100 - 0 - 0 = 100

# Gate does not expire (schema migrations are permanent)
expires: null

# ============ Evidence and Traceability ============

evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 18
  risks_identified: 0
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4]  # All ACs have test coverage
    ac_gaps: []  # No coverage gaps

# ============ Non-Functional Requirements Validation ============

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Foreign key constraint prevents orphaned records. CHECK constraint prevents invalid status values. ON DELETE SET NULL preserves audit trail. JSONB type validated by PostgreSQL."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All recommended indexes created: tool_id (UNIQUE), status, is_exported, created_at DESC. JSONB for flexible metadata avoids EAV anti-pattern."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Idempotent migration with IF NOT EXISTS. Rollback script provided. Comprehensive test coverage (18 tests). Trigger ensures data consistency."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation: SQL COMMENT on every column, comprehensive JSDoc on TypeScript types. Clear naming conventions. Tests serve as living documentation."
