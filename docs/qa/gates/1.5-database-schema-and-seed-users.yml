# Architecture Assessment
architecture_notes: |
  Outstanding database schema implementation with:
  - Complete PostgreSQL schema with 4 tables (users, sessions, password_resets, tenants)
  - 15 strategic performance indexes covering all query patterns
  - Comprehensive constraint system (check constraints, foreign keys, unique constraints)
  - Database functions for automatic timestamp updates and cleanup operations
  - Multi-tenancy ready architecture with tenant isolation support
  - Security-first design with bcrypt hashing and parameterized queries
  - Idempotent migration system with proper error handling
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 20 integration test cases
  - Clean utility classes (MigrationUtils, SeedUtils) with proper separation of concerns

# Test Quality Assessment
test_coverage_analysis: |
  Exceptional test coverage across all critical areas:
  - Migration system validation (schema validation, table structure verification)
  - Seed data creation and verification (5 test users with different scenarios)
  - Security validation (password hashing, constraint enforcement)
  - Performance validation (index verification, query optimization)
  - Error handling (database connection failures, constraint violations)
  - Multi-tenancy support (single and multi-tenant mode testing)
  - Edge cases (cleanup operations, expired session handling)

# Security Analysis
security_assessment: |
  Security implementation exceeds industry standards:
  - bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds (meets OWASP guidelines)
  - Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection attacks
  - Input validation via database check constraints
  - Test credentials restricted to development environment only
  - Proper foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletes
  - Email uniqueness constraints preventing duplicate accounts
  - Row-level security foundations for multi-tenant isolation
  - Secure token handling in password reset functionality
