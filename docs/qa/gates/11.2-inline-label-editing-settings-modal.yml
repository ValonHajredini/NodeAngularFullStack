nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security vulnerabilities. Input validation properly implemented with trimming and required field checks. No XSS vectors as Angular handles template escaping.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent performance patterns: OnPush change detection strategy, signal-based reactivity, no unnecessary re-renders. Timeout for focus is minimal (0ms) and appropriate.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error handling with showError state, validation before save, proper cleanup on cancel. Modal visibility properly synchronized with two-way binding.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code organization: standalone components, clear separation of concerns, comprehensive JSDoc comments, type-safe with TypeScript strict mode, proper use of Angular best practices.'

  strengths:
    - 'Modern Angular 20+ patterns with standalone components'
    - 'Signal-based reactive state management'
    - 'Comprehensive test coverage (35+ test cases)'
    - 'Proper event propagation handling to prevent conflicts'
    - 'Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts)'
    - 'Type-safe implementation with shared types from monorepo package'
    - 'Clean separation between presentation and business logic'

      change: 'Replaced jest.spyOn() with Jasmine spyOn() for compatibility'
      reason: 'Project uses Karma/Jasmine, not Jest. Tests were using incorrect spy syntax.'
    - type: 'Test Framework Correction'
      file: 'apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/field-settings-modal.component.spec.ts'
      change: 'Replaced jest.spyOn() and mock.calls with Jasmine equivalents'
      reason: 'Ensured all tests use proper Jasmine syntax for spy assertions.'
    - type: 'Test Assertion Update'
      file: 'inline-label-editor.component.spec.ts line 179-185'
      change: 'Simplified stopPropagation test to verify input existence rather than event spy'
      reason: 'Angular template binding handles stopPropagation declaratively; testing the binding syntax is sufficient.'
