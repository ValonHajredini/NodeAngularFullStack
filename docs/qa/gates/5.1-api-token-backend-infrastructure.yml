# Implementation quality notes
implementation_notes: |
  Despite the FAIL gate due to missing tests, the actual code implementation is excellent:
  - Follows all architectural patterns correctly
  - Security implementation is exemplary
  - Database design is comprehensive and well-indexed
  - Multi-tenancy support is properly maintained
  - Error handling and validation are robust
  - Documentation and TypeScript interfaces are thorough

  This is a rare case where implementation quality is high but gate fails due to
  missing critical test coverage on authentication system changes.
