# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Display-only field, no user input, no XSS vectors. Angular template binding auto-escapes HTML. Inline styles use property binding, not innerHTML. ColorPicker component handles validation. Excluded from form submissions."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "OnPush change detection strategy. Angular signals (no watchers). Minimal bundle impact (~150 lines). Tailwind utility classes purged in production. No runtime overhead (static rendering)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Simple rendering logic. No complex state management. Optional metadata with sensible defaults. Proper null/undefined handling. Backward compatible with forms without HEADING."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Follows existing field type patterns exactly. Comprehensive JSDoc comments. TypeScript strict mode compliance. Standalone component with clear separation of concerns. Signal-based reactive state."

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Add heading hierarchy validation (warn if H1 follows H3)"
      refs: ["field-properties.component.ts"]
      rationale: "Improve accessibility by detecting illogical heading order"
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Implement WCAG color contrast checker (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)"
      refs: ["field-properties.component.ts"]
      rationale: "Automate accessibility compliance for color choices"
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Add accessibility hints in field properties modal"
      refs: ["field-properties.component.ts"]
      rationale: "Guide users toward accessible heading usage (e.g., 'H2 recommended for section titles')"
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Support custom CSS classes for advanced styling"
      refs: ["forms.types.ts", "heading-preview.component.ts"]
      rationale: "Enable advanced customization for power users"
      priority: "future-enhancement"

# Accessibility assessment
accessibility:
  wcag_level: "AA (Partial - Foundation Implemented)"
  semantic_html: true
  aria_attributes: false
  keyboard_navigation: "N/A (display-only field)"
  screen_reader_tested: false
  color_contrast_validated: false
  notes: "Uses semantic HTML <h1>-<h6> tags. Configurable heading levels, alignment, color, and weight. User responsible for heading hierarchy and color contrast. Recommend future enhancement for automated validation."

# Test coverage analysis
test_coverage:
  unit_tests: 5
  integration_tests: 0
  e2e_tests: 0
  manual_tests: 0
  coverage_percentage: "estimated 90%"
  notes: "Comprehensive unit tests for HeadingPreviewComponent (heading level rendering, alignment, color, font weight). Integration tests not required for display-only field. TypeScript compilation passes clean."

# Pattern adherence
patterns:
  field_type_pattern: true
  service_layer: true
  signal_based_state: true
  standalone_component: true
  onpush_change_detection: true
  row_layout_integration: true
  data_exclusion: true
  notes: "Perfect adherence to established field type patterns. Follows palette → service → canvas → properties → renderer workflow. Properly excluded from FormGroup validation and submission data."
