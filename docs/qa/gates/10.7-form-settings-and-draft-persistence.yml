# Quality Gate Decision - Story 10.7
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

story: "10.7"
story_title: "Form Settings and Draft Persistence"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical test failures blocking production readiness. Integration tests fail due to invalid test data (non-UUID user IDs). Frontend test suite has pre-existing compilation errors preventing verification of new functionality. Code implementation is excellent, but testing infrastructure must be fixed before gate can pass."

    severity: high
    finding: "Frontend test compilation blocked - 89 TypeScript errors in pre-existing test files prevent running new form-builder test suites"
    suggested_action: "Fix pre-existing test compilation errors in tool.guard.spec.ts, main-layout.component.spec.ts, avatar-upload.component.spec.ts, search-filter.component.spec.ts before adding new tests"

    severity: medium
    finding: "Unsaved changes guard uses inject() inside Promise executor which violates Angular injection context rules (may fail in future Angular versions)"
    suggested_action: "Refactor unsaved-changes.guard.ts to inject ConfirmationService at guard function level, not inside Promise callback"

  highest: critical
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix integration test UUID issue - blocks verification of publish/unpublish functionality (AC4, AC10)"
      - "Resolve frontend test compilation errors - prevents verification of unit tests for forms-api.service, forms-list, unsaved-changes.guard"
    monitor:
      - "Unsaved changes guard injection pattern may break in future Angular versions"
      - "Auto-save functionality lacks automated test coverage"

evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 0  # Unable to run tests due to compilation failures
  risks_identified: 6
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]  # Implementation verified via code review

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security implementation. JWT-based publish tokens with expiration, proper auth middleware, tenant isolation, input validation with express-validator. Schema validation prevents XSS via regex validation. API uses parameterized queries preventing SQL injection."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-optimized. OnPush change detection, signal-based reactivity, 30-second auto-save with debouncing prevents excessive API calls, pagination implemented for forms list (page size 9), proper cleanup in ngOnDestroy prevents memory leaks."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Code implementation is solid with comprehensive error handling, proper Observable patterns, null safety throughout. However, lack of passing tests creates reliability concerns for production deployment. Auto-save interval cleanup verified in code."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent maintainability. Comprehensive JSDoc on all services and components, clear separation of concerns (FormsApiService, FormBuilderService, components), shared types in packages/shared, modern Angular patterns (standalone, signals). Code is self-documenting."
  testability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Critical testability issues. Integration tests fail due to test data problems. Frontend tests cannot compile due to pre-existing errors. Test files exist but cannot execute. This blocks production readiness verification."
