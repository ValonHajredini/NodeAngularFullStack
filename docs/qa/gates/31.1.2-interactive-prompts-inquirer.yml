# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "31.1.2"
story_title: "Interactive Prompts with Inquirer"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Implementation is excellent with comprehensive validation and documentation, but lacks automated test coverage for utilities that will be reused across the tool generation system."

# Top issues identified
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "No unit tests for string-helpers utilities (toKebabCase, validateToolId, validateToolName, generateDefaultId)"
    impact: "These utilities will be reused throughout the tool generation system. Bugs could propagate to all generated tools."
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive unit tests covering happy paths, edge cases (special chars, max lengths), and validation boundaries"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    refs:
      - "packages/create-tool/src/utils/string-helpers.ts"

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No unit tests for prompt validation logic"
    impact: "Validation errors could lead to malformed tool IDs or metadata, breaking tool generation in future stories"
    suggested_action: "Add unit tests for each validation function (description length, features array, tool name/ID patterns)"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "TEST-003"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No integration test for CLI prompt flow"
    impact: "Future Inquirer version upgrades or refactoring could break the prompt flow without detection"
    suggested_action: "Add integration test mocking inquirer to verify full metadata collection flow, cancellation handling, and TTY checks"

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security vulnerabilities. Input validation prevents malformed data. No file writes, network calls, or sensitive data handling. Dependencies have no known CVEs."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance. CLI startup <100ms. Refactored toKebabCase to remove redundant toLowerCase() call. Lightweight dependencies."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling implemented (TTY, SIGINT, uncaughtException, unhandledRejection), but zero automated tests create regression risk for future changes."

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Excellent code documentation and structure, but missing test foundation makes future refactoring risky. No safety net for dependency upgrades."

# Recommendations by priority
recommendations:
  immediate:  # Required before production
    - action: "Add unit tests for string-helpers.ts (toKebabCase, validateToolId, validateToolName, generateDefaultId)"
      priority: "HIGH"
      estimate: "4-6 hours"
      refs:
        - "packages/create-tool/src/utils/string-helpers.ts"
      rationale: "These utilities will be reused across all tool generation stories. Bugs will propagate system-wide."

  future:  # Can be addressed in later sprints
    - action: "Add integration test for CLI prompt flow"
      priority: "MEDIUM"
      estimate: "2-3 hours"
      refs:
        - "packages/create-tool/src/index.ts"
      rationale: "Ensures prompt flow remains stable through Inquirer upgrades and refactoring."

    - action: "Add unit tests for prompt validation functions"
      priority: "MEDIUM"
      estimate: "2-3 hours"
      refs:
        - "packages/create-tool/src/prompts/tool-prompts.ts"
      rationale: "Validates that validation logic itself is correct and handles edge cases."

    - action: "Configure ESLint for create-tool package"
      priority: "LOW"
      estimate: "1 hour"
      refs:
        - "packages/create-tool/package.json:15"
      rationale: "Ensures consistent code style and catches common errors."

# Compliance checklist
compliance:
  coding_standards: true  # JSDoc, TypeScript strict mode, error handling
  project_structure: true  # Correct directory organization, ESM exports
  testing_strategy: false  # No automated tests (critical gap)
  acceptance_criteria: true  # All 5 ACs functionally met

# Files modified during QA review
files_modified:
  - path: "packages/create-tool/src/utils/string-helpers.ts"
    change: "Removed redundant toLowerCase() call (line 39)"
    rationale: "Performance optimization - string already lowercased on line 35"
    verification: "Build successful, TypeScript compilation passed"
