nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CSS and service code only - no XSS vectors, no authentication/authorization concerns, no executable code injection risks"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient CSS using native Grid/Flexbox, minimal specificity, leverages browser CSS variable engine, 300ms transition timing appropriate"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive fallback chain prevents missing styles, backward compatibility with legacy variable names, graceful degradation with default values"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (comprehensive header + inline comments), clear variable naming, 65 test cases ensure future changes don't break functionality, zero technical debt introduced"

# Recommendations for future work (not blocking)
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: "Consider E2E tests for full responsive breakpoint validation"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/styles/theme-variables.css:378-432"]
      rationale: "Karma has limitations for media query testing - E2E would provide full coverage"
    - action: "Monitor theme performance with complex forms in production"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/theme-preview.service.ts"]
      rationale: "Validate transition performance on low-end mobile devices with 100+ field forms"

# Test architecture assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage_summary: "65 test cases covering all 18 utility classes, service integration, transitions, and CSS compilation"
  test_levels:
    unit: "65 test cases (Karma + Jasmine)"
    integration: "Service integration tests included"
    e2e: "Recommended for responsive breakpoint validation (not blocking)"
  test_quality: "EXCELLENT"
  test_maintainability: "HIGH"
