# Final Assessment
final_notes: |
  RE-REVIEW COMPLETED: This is exemplary service layer implementation demonstrating professional
  engineering practices. The code is production-ready with exceptional test coverage, comprehensive
  documentation, and proper Clean Architecture adherence.

  During re-review, identified and resolved a JSDoc documentation inconsistency where the service
  implementation referenced "alpha" status transitions not defined in shared types. JSDoc has been
  corrected to match the actual implementation (beta, active, deprecated only).

  The only remaining concern is story documentation (Dev Notes, Business Logic Rules) mentioning
  alpha status, which is a low-priority documentation clarification that doesn't affect code
  correctness.

  Gate upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS. All code is production-ready and fully tested.

  Recommended action: Story approved for Done status. Story documentation clarification is optional
  and can be addressed in future retrospective or when/if alpha status is added to product roadmap.
