# Quality Assessment
quality_score: 100
expires: "2025-11-07T00:00:00Z"

# Evidence
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 13
  tests_passed: 13
  risks_identified: 0
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # All ACs have test coverage
    ac_gaps: []  # No coverage gaps

# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Environment variables properly used, no hardcoded credentials, fail-fast design prevents insecure defaults from being used in production"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Connection pooling configured with appropriate limits (max 20, idle timeout 30s, connection timeout 2s). Leaves headroom for PostgreSQL default max_connections=100"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation pattern (health check returns false instead of throwing). Error event handler logs unexpected errors. Graceful shutdown support for clean termination"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples. Clear module structure. Self-documenting code with inline comments explaining configuration choices"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding runtime validation for required environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME) to fail fast with clear error messages during startup"
      refs: ["apps/api/src/config/database.config.ts:32-41"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current fail-fast design on first query is acceptable, but explicit startup validation would improve developer experience"
    - action: "Consider integrating error event handler with monitoring/alerting system (Sentry, Logtail) when available"
      refs: ["apps/api/src/config/database.config.ts:125-128"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current console.error logging is adequate for development, but production should have alerting"

# Test Architecture Assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage: "Complete - all 5 acceptance criteria have corresponding tests"
  test_levels: "Appropriate - unit tests with pg module mocking, integration tests deferred to Story 30.1.4"
  test_design: "Excellent - clear descriptions, proper mocking, isolated tests, proper cleanup"
  edge_cases: "Complete - success path, failure path, error logging, graceful shutdown, error events"
  maintainability: "High - clear test structure, reusable mocks, good beforeEach cleanup pattern"

# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  architecture: "Excellent - singleton pattern for connection pool, separation of concerns"
  standards_compliance: "Complete - follows all project coding standards, uses nullish coalescing operator per ESLint rules"
  documentation: "Excellent - comprehensive JSDoc with module-level and function-level docs, usage examples"
  technical_debt: "None identified"
  security: "Good - no hardcoded credentials, proper environment variable usage"
