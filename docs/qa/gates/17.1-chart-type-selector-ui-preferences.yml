# Acceptance criteria verification
acceptance_criteria_status:
  ac_1_chart_selector_ui: PASS  # Selector in field card header with all 8 chart types
  ac_2_selection_behavior: PASS  # Immediate update, no reload, persists to localStorage
  ac_3_service_implementation: PASS  # All 4 methods with correct signatures
  ac_4_existing_functionality: PASS  # No regression in table, export, statistics
  ac_5_component_integration: PASS  # Service injected, signals working, reactive updates
  ac_6_backward_compatibility: PASS  # Defaults match existing behavior
  ac_7_service_unit_tests: PASS  # 188 lines, comprehensive coverage
  ac_8_component_integration_tests: CONCERNS  # Tests missing for UI behavior
  ac_9_accessibility: PASS  # ARIA labels, keyboard navigation via native select

# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate status of CONCERNS is justified because:

  1. **Functional Implementation:** All 9 acceptance criteria functionally implemented
  2. **Service Quality:** ChartPreferenceService is production-ready with excellent tests
  3. **Test Gap:** Missing component integration tests for chart type selector UI (AC #8)
  4. **Risk Assessment:** Low-medium risk - functionality verified via code review
  5. **Deployment Impact:** Does not block deployment but should address before next story

  The implementation quality is high (Quality Score: 90/100), and the primary concern
  is addressable with ~1 hour of test development effort. The service layer is robust
  with comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage.

  Recommendation: Address component integration tests before proceeding to Story 17.2
  to maintain test coverage consistency and enable confident future refactoring.
