  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Address pre-existing test infrastructure issues to enable Story 10.5 test execution"
      refs:
        - "Multiple unrelated test failures in tool.guard.spec.ts, main-layout.component.spec.ts, etc."
    - action: "Consider extracting field icon mapping to shared constant for reusability"

# Code quality highlights
highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns: presentation (components), state management (service), and drag-drop logic"
    - "Excellent use of Angular signals for reactive state management"
    - "OnPush change detection strategy for optimal performance"
    - "Comprehensive keyboard accessibility implementation exceeds basic requirements"
    - "Unique field name generation with collision detection is robust"
    - "Error-free TypeScript compilation demonstrates type safety"
    - "Production build successful with reasonable bundle sizes (604.58 kB initial, 143.71 kB transferred)"
    - "✅ JSDoc documentation complete - all public methods properly documented (DOC-001 resolved)"

  architecture_patterns:
    - "Angular CDK drag-drop integration follows best practices"
    - "Signal-based state management is modern Angular 20+ pattern"
    - "Standalone components align with Angular 20+ architecture"
    - "Computed signals used effectively for derived state"

  technical_debt:
    - "No new technical debt introduced by Story 10.5"
    - "Pre-existing codebase issues (lint errors, test failures) not caused by this story"
