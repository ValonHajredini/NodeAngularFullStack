# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "UUID v4 for step IDs. PrimeNG MessageService for user feedback. Input validation via reactive forms (1-100 chars for title, max 500 for description). No XSS vulnerabilities in step management."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "OnPush change detection strategy. Signal-based state management for optimal reactivity. Computed signals for derived state. Angular CDK Drag-Drop with optimized rendering. Maximum 10 steps prevents resource exhaustion."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with confirmation dialogs for destructive actions. 45+ tests passing provides high confidence. Toast notifications for user feedback. Prevents deletion of last step. Handles step reordering correctly."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exemplary JSDoc documentation for all public methods. Clear separation of concerns with service layer. Modern Angular 20+ standalone components. Type-safe signals and computed properties. Zero code duplication."

    - action: "Consider adding E2E tests for complete step form workflow (create form → enable steps → add/edit/delete steps → save → verify persistence)"

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive test coverage: 15+ component tests + 30+ service tests covering all acceptance criteria including edge cases, boundary conditions, and backward compatibility"
    - "Modern Angular 20+ patterns: Standalone components with OnPush change detection, signals for state management, computed signals for derived state"
    - "Excellent UX: Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions, toast notifications, disabled states with tooltips, drag-drop reordering with visual feedback"
    - "Type safety excellence: Shared types from @nodeangularfullstack/shared with complete JSDoc documentation"
    - "Signal-based architecture: Reactive state with computed signals (canAddStep, canDeleteStep, activeStep) for optimal performance"
    - "Feature flag pattern: stepForm.enabled ensures zero breaking changes for existing forms"
    - "Backward compatibility: Forms without step configuration continue to work seamlessly"
    - "Comprehensive validation: Reactive forms with inline validation, character counters, min/max length enforcement"

  areas_of_excellence:
    - component_architecture: "Standalone component with OnPush strategy, signal-based state, and PrimeNG UI components"
    - test_quality: "100% pass rate with coverage of enable/disable toggles, add/edit/delete operations, drag-drop reordering, validation, and computed signals"
    - documentation: "JSDoc documentation exceeds requirements with examples, parameter descriptions, and clear method purposes"
    - code_organization: "Perfect adherence to project structure with components in correct locations and proper imports"
    - user_experience: "Intuitive UI with confirmation dialogs, toast notifications, tooltips, and visual feedback for all operations"

# Acceptance criteria validation
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: 1
    description: "User can toggle step form mode on/off"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "StepFormSidebarComponent implements toggle with p-toggleButton. Confirmation dialogs for enable/disable. Tests verify onToggleStepForm, confirmEnableStepForm, confirmDisableStepForm methods. FormBuilderService.enableStepForm() and disableStepForm() tested."

  - id: 2
    description: "Enabling step form creates default first step and migrates existing fields"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "FormBuilderService.enableStepForm() creates default step (id, title='Step 1', order=0) and calls migrateFieldsToStep(). Tests verify field migration: all fields receive position.stepId = firstStep.id."

  - id: 3
    description: "User can add up to 10 steps total"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Component has 'Add Step' button with canAddStep() computed signal (steps().length < 10). Tests verify adding steps up to 10 and button disabled state. Service.addStep() method tested."

  - id: 4
    description: "User can reorder steps via drag-and-drop"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Angular CDK Drag-Drop with cdkDropList and cdkDrag directives. onStepDrop() calls FormBuilderService.reorderSteps(). Tests verify drag-drop event handling and order index updates."

  - id: 5
    description: "User can edit step title and description via modal dialog"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Edit dialog with reactive form (title: 1-100 chars required, description: max 500 chars). onEditStep() opens dialog, onSaveStep() calls service.updateStep(). Tests verify validation and save operations."

  - id: 6
    description: "User can delete steps (except when only 1 step remains)"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Delete button with canDeleteStep() computed signal (steps().length > 1). Confirmation dialog before deletion. Service.removeStep() tested with single-step protection and field reassignment to first step."

  - id: 7
    description: "Step configuration persists when saving form"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "FormBuilderService.exportFormData() includes stepForm config when enabled. loadForm() restores step config from schema. Tests verify serialization/deserialization with stepForm.enabled and steps array."

  - id: 8
    description: "Component tests achieve >80% coverage"
    status: PASS
    evidence: "45 tests total (15 component + 30 service) with 100% pass rate. Coverage exceeds 80% requirement for step form components, service methods, validation, and edge cases."
