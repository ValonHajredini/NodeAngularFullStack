# Evidence from review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 30
  risks_identified: 4
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]  # 9 ACs fully covered

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client-side only calculations, read-only data access, proper escaping, no injection risks. No API endpoints added."

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Pure functions with O(n) complexity and computed signals are efficient, but no actual benchmarking for 1000 submissions. Missing lazy loading and virtual scrolling for large datasets."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive edge case handling (null, NaN, empty arrays). TypeScript strict mode enforces type safety. No side effects in pure functions."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with comprehensive JSDoc, consistent patterns, proper separation of concerns. Chart components follow DRY principles. Well-organized directory structure."

# Testing summary
testing:
  unit_tests:
    status: EXCELLENT
    coverage: ">90%"
