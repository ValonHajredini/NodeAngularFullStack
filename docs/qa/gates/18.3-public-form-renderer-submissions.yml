# Final Verdict
final_verdict: |
  **PASS** - This story is production-ready and approved for merge.

  The ImageGalleryRendererComponent implementation is excellent, demonstrating:
  - Clean architecture following existing field renderer patterns
  - Comprehensive test coverage (22 tests, 220% of minimum requirement)
  - Perfect integration with FormRendererComponent (both row and global layouts)
  - Proper validation and error handling
  - Accessibility support inherited from ImageGallerySelectorComponent
  - No breaking changes or compatibility issues

  The only minor concern (E2E testing pending) is non-blocking since it's caused by
  pre-existing dev server issues unrelated to this story. The component implementation
  is complete, well-tested, and ready for production use.

  **Epic 18 Status:** All 3 stories complete (18.1, 18.2, 18.3) - Epic 18 is DONE.
