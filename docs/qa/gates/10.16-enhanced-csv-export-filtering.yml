# Quality Gate Decision - Story 10.16
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "10.16"
story_title: "Enhanced CSV Export & Data Filtering"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical implementation issues prevent production deployment: integration tests have TypeScript errors and cannot run, PrimeNG Calendar module dependency missing causing frontend build failures, SQL injection vulnerability in date filtering, and missing performance testing for large dataset exports. Core export functionality is implemented but requires fixes before deployment."

top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-CRITICAL-001"
    severity: critical
    finding: "Integration tests completely broken - TypeScript compilation errors prevent test execution"
    impact: "Cannot validate export filtering functionality works correctly. Tests reference non-existent methods (databaseService.connect/disconnect, formSchemasRepository.create) and incorrect user creation API."
    suggested_action: "Fix test file to match actual repository and service APIs. Reference existing working integration tests for correct patterns."
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/api/tests/integration/export-submissions-filtering.test.ts"]
  - id: "BUILD-CRITICAL-001"
    severity: critical
    finding: "Frontend build fails due to missing PrimeNG Calendar module dependency"
    impact: "Cannot build or test frontend application. Error: 'Cannot find module primeng/calendar'. This breaks the entire frontend test suite."
    suggested_action: "Either install primeng/calendar or use alternative date picker component that's already in dependencies (e.g., PrimeNG DatePicker from primeng/datepicker)"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-analytics/export-dialog.component.ts:7"]
  - id: "SEC-CRITICAL-001"
    severity: critical
    finding: "SQL injection vulnerability in date filtering - uses string interpolation in SQL query"
    impact: "Repository uses unsafe string interpolation for INTERVAL clause: 'WHERE submitted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '${hoursAgo} hours''. While this specific case uses a number, the pattern is dangerous and inconsistent with parameterized queries used elsewhere."
    suggested_action: "Refactor to use PostgreSQL interval parameter or calculated timestamp: 'WHERE submitted_at > NOW() - $1 * INTERVAL '1 hour''"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/api/src/repositories/form-submissions.repository.ts:285"]
  - id: "SEC-HIGH-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Potential SQL injection in field filter implementation"
    impact: "Field name inserted directly into SQL query: 'fs.values_json->>''${filter.field}'' = $N'. While the field value is parameterized, the field name is not validated against schema, allowing potential injection."
    suggested_action: "Validate field names against form schema BEFORE building query. Whitelist approach already partially implemented but needs to be enforced in repository layer."
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/api/src/repositories/form-submissions.repository.ts:187"]
  - id: "PERF-HIGH-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "No performance testing for large dataset exports (10k, 100k rows)"
    impact: "Story requires exports of 100k submissions in <60s, but no tests validate this. Streaming implementation present but untested."
    suggested_action: "Create performance test suite with synthetic data (10k, 100k submissions) to validate memory usage <100MB and time requirements."
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["Story AC 16: Performance Testing"]
  - id: "CODE-HIGH-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Export streaming logic has potential bug in subsequent batches"
    impact: "First batch writes headers correctly, but subsequent batches reconstruct selectedFields from first submission. If field order differs or fields are missing in later submissions, CSV structure becomes inconsistent."
    suggested_action: "Store selectedFields from first batch and reuse for all subsequent batches to ensure consistent CSV column structure."
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/api/src/controllers/forms.controller.ts:702"]
  - id: "TEST-HIGH-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Frontend unit tests cannot be executed due to build errors"
    impact: "Export dialog component has comprehensive test file (260 lines, 12 test cases) but cannot run due to PrimeNG Calendar dependency issue."
    suggested_action: "Fix PrimeNG Calendar import issue, then run tests to validate component behavior."
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-analytics/export-dialog.component.spec.ts"]
  - id: "UX-MEDIUM-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Export preview shows total submissions, not filtered count"
    impact: "User sees 'Estimated rows: 1000' even when filters would reduce export to 10 rows. Misleading and acknowledged in TODO comment."
    suggested_action: "Add API endpoint to get filtered count, or clearly label as 'Total Available' instead of 'Estimated'"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: ["apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-analytics/export-dialog.component.ts:208-211"]
  - id: "CODE-MEDIUM-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Error handling uses console.error instead of proper toast notification"
    impact: "Export failures log to console but don't show user-friendly error message. TODO comment acknowledges this."
    suggested_action: "Integrate with application's toast notification service for export errors"

      Reliability Score: 50/100 (Good error handling but untested)
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✓ Excellent JSDoc documentation on all public methods
      ✓ Clear separation of concerns (controller → service → repository)
      ✓ Follows existing patterns (AsyncHandler, ApiError)
      ✓ Type-safe with shared SubmissionFilterOptions interface
      ✓ Consistent with codebase architecture
      ✓ Frontend component well-structured with signals
      ⚠ TODO comments indicate incomplete features
