# Quality Gate: Story 25.2 - Extend Theme Types and Service State Management
schema: 1
story: "25.2"
story_title: "Extend Theme Types and Service State Management"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is solid with excellent type safety and comprehensive signal-based state management. However, missing unit tests (Task 9) and manual integration testing (Task 11) prevent a PASS gate. All type definitions, getters/setters, and backward compatibility requirements are fully met."

top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Service unit tests completely missing (Task 9 marked as deferred)"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive unit tests for all 24 container styling signals, getters, setters, validation logic, and backward compatibility"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Manual integration testing not performed (Task 11 marked as deferred)"
    suggested_action: "Test container styling UI integration with service signals before marking story as Done"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Shared package missing 'typecheck' npm script (AC 11 mentions running typecheck for shared)"
    suggested_action: "Add 'typecheck' script to packages/shared/package.json for consistency"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Add service unit tests before production deployment (TEST-001)"
      - "Perform manual integration testing with Story 25.1 UI (TEST-002)"
    monitor:
      - "Consider adding typecheck script to shared package for CI/CD consistency"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Type-safe validation in setters prevents invalid state. No user input directly handled (UI layer validates)"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent use of Angular signals for fine-grained reactivity. Computed theme object only recalculates when dependencies change. Clamping validation is O(1)"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Backward compatibility properly handled with nullish coalescing. However, lack of tests means reliability cannot be verified"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation on all getters/setters. Clear naming conventions. Well-organized signal groups. TypeScript strict mode compliance"
