nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Backend validator properly validates fractional unit syntax with 45 comprehensive tests. Rejects invalid input (negative values, decimals, leading zeros, non-fr units)."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No performance measurements provided. AC 12 requires <50ms width change and <100ms canvas re-render verification."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling comprehensive with descriptive messages. Signal-based reactivity ensures consistent state updates."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code is clean, well-documented with JSDoc comments. Consistent patterns across FormCanvasComponent and FormRendererComponent."

technical_strengths:
  - "Comprehensive backend validator with 45 passing tests covering edge cases (leading zeros, decimals, negative values, whitespace)"
  - "Frontend service has 13 unit tests with excellent coverage (error cases, signal reactivity, multiple updates, row isolation)"
  - "Signal-based reactive architecture eliminates manual refresh logic"
  - "Backward compatibility built-in with graceful fallback to equal widths when columnWidths undefined"
  - "Consistent implementation pattern across FormCanvasComponent.getColumnGridTemplate() and FormRendererComponent.getGridColumns()"
  - "Type safety with columnWidths?: string[] properly defined in RowLayoutConfig"
  - "Clear error messages for validation failures (both frontend and backend)"
