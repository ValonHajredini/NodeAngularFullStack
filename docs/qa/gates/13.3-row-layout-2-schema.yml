# Quality Gate: Story 13.3 - Row-Column Configuration & Schema
schema: 1
story: "13.3"
story_title: "Row-Column Configuration & Schema - Brownfield Addition"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation quality excellent with all ACs met, but component spec file outdated (Story 1 API) and pre-existing test failures prevent automated validation. Production release should be deferred until spec rewritten."

  immediate:
    - action: "Rewrite row-layout-sidebar.component.spec.ts for Story 2 API"

      priority: "Must fix before production release"

    - action: "Perform comprehensive manual testing verification"
      refs: ["Story 13.3 QA Results section"]
      priority: "Required for production confidence"
      checklist:
        - "Toggle row layout enable/disable"
        - "Add/remove rows via UI"
        - "Change column count (1-4 buttons)"
        - "Migration from global to row-based layout"
        - "Schema serialization/deserialization (save/load form)"
        - "Backward compatibility (load form without row layout)"

  future:
    - action: "Fix pre-existing test suite failures (45+ compilation errors)"
      refs: ["Test execution logs"]
      priority: "Tech debt - create separate ticket"

    - action: "Enhance migration helper to read actual global column setting"

notes: |
  ARCHITECTURE EXCELLENCE:
  - Clean separation: types → service → UI
  - Reactive signal-based state (computed signals prevent waste)
  - Proper Angular patterns (standalone, OnPush, ARIA attributes)
  - Backward compatibility via optional schema properties

  IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:
  - fieldsByRow computed signal efficiently groups fields
  - Orphaned field handling ensures data integrity
  - Migration helper enables smooth transition
  - Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss

  TEST COVERAGE:
  - Service layer: 16 comprehensive test suites (EXCELLENT but cannot run)
  - Component layer: Outdated spec (tests Story 1 API, needs rewrite)
  - Manual testing required for production confidence

  RECOMMENDATION:
  Story owner should:
  1. ✅ APPROVE implementation quality (all ACs met)
  2. ⚠️ DEFER production release until spec rewritten
  3. ✅ PROCEED with Story 3 (dependencies satisfied)
