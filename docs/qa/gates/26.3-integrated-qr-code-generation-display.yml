# Implementation Highlights (positive findings)
strengths:
  - "Excellent reuse of existing QrCodeDisplayComponent from short-links tool"
  - "Proper asynchronous QR generation that doesn't block publishing workflow"
  - "Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation patterns"
  - "Well-structured service layer following established repository patterns"
  - "Database schema properly extended with migration and indexing"
  - "Clean separation between form publishing and QR generation concerns"

# Critical Blocking Issues for FAIL gate
blocking_issues:
  - "All test files have TypeScript compilation errors preventing execution"
  - "Cannot validate any acceptance criteria without working test suite"
  - "Risk of production deployment with untested functionality"
  - "Quality standards violation - tests must pass before deployment"
