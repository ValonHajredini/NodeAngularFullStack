      priority: "LOW"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/app/layouts/main-layout/main-layout.component.spec.ts"]

    - action: "Backend test architecture refactor"
      rationale: "Test setup pattern conflict (global vs local DB init) - 202 tests affected"
      effort: "4-6 hours"

      refs: ["apps/api/tests/"]

    - action: "Continue incremental ESLint remediation"
