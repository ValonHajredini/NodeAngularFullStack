summary: |
  Story 9.2 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive test coverage,
  proper architecture patterns, and adherence to coding standards. All 6 acceptance criteria
  are fully met and properly tested. The Command pattern for undo/redo is textbook implementation.
  Code is production-ready with no blocking issues identified.

  Key Strengths:
  - Comprehensive unit test coverage (65+ test cases)
  - Proper use of Angular signals and reactive patterns
  - Clean separation of concerns with standalone components
  - Industry-standard algorithms (ray-casting, point-to-line distance)
  - Command pattern for undo/redo with history management
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Proper JSDoc documentation

  The implementation is production-ready and sets a strong foundation for additional
  drawing features in future stories.
