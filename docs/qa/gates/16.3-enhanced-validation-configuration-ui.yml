# Test Coverage Analysis
test_coverage:
  backend:
    unit_tests: 17  # safe-regex.util.test.ts
    integration_tests: 5  # forms.test.ts (ReDoS scenarios)
    coverage_areas:
      - "ReDoS vulnerability detection (safe-regex)"
      - "Pattern syntax validation"
      - "Length limit enforcement (500 chars)"
      - "Nested quantifier detection"
      - "Multiple error scenarios"
      - "Edge cases (whitespace, escaped chars)"
  frontend:
    unit_tests: 12  # validation-presets.service.spec.ts
    component_tests: 4  # field-properties validation sections
    coverage_areas:
      - "Validation preset service (getPresets, getPreset)"
      - "Pattern preset selection and auto-fill"
      - "Error message textarea with character counter"
      - "Min/Max range validation"
      - "Canvas preview validation badges"

# Implementation Quality Highlights
highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Complete implementation of all validation UI components"
    - "Comprehensive ReDoS security protection (17 passing tests)"
    - "User-friendly pattern preset dropdown (Email, Phone, URL, Custom)"
    - "Custom error message support with 200-char limit"
    - "Canvas preview validation indicators (Required badge, Pattern/Length/Range chips)"
    - "Backward compatibility with existing forms"
    - "Clean architecture with ValidationPresetsService and safe-regex utility"

  security_measures:
    - "Server-side safe-regex validation (mandatory)"
    - "Pattern length limit (500 characters)"
    - "Nested quantifier detection (max 3)"
    - "Execution timeout enforcement (100ms documented)"
    - "Client-side regex syntax validator (advisory)"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage of ReDoS patterns"

  test_quality:
    - "17 comprehensive ReDoS security tests covering safe/unsafe patterns"
    - "12 ValidationPresetsService tests with pattern matching validation"
    - "Integration tests for form submission with ReDoS patterns"
    - "Clear Given-When-Then structure in tests"
    - "Edge cases well covered (empty, length limits, multiple errors)"

# Recommendations for Future Enhancements
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No must-fix items
  future:
    - action: "Consider memoizing ValidationPresetsService.getPresets() result"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/field-properties/validation-presets.service.ts:70"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Minor optimization if method called frequently, but current implementation is production-ready"
