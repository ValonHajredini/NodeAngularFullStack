story: "27.5"
story_title: "Drag-and-Drop Sub-Column Support"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All critical issues resolved from FAIL gate (60/100 → 90/100). Unit tests implemented, performance optimized, runtime validation added. Minor concerns: integration tests pending (Task 10), AC7/AC9 have partial coverage."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. Angular sanitization, state encapsulation, no user input."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Computed signal optimization (fieldsBySubColumn) achieves O(1) lookup. Scales to 1000+ fields."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Runtime validation prevents TypeErrors from malformed CDK events. Error toast on failure."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear method names, JSDoc comments, BEM-like CSS, proper separation of concerns."
