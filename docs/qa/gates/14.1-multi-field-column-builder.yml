# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security risks - orderInColumn is server-controlled metadata, no user input validation issues, no XSS/injection vectors, no auth changes, additive schema changes only"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance design - computed signals with automatic caching, O(n log n) sorting efficiency, no N+1 queries, immutable state updates for efficient change detection"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, robust field shifting logic, proper null checks, backward compatibility ensures existing forms continue working without modification"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with excellent documentation (JSDoc comments), clear separation of concerns, signal-based reactive architecture, follows TypeScript strict mode, well-tested"

    - "Comprehensive test coverage (14+ new test cases covering all scenarios)"
    - "Excellent documentation (JSDoc comments + CLAUDE.md updates)"
    - "Zero breaking changes to existing APIs"
    - "Elegant schema evolution using optional properties (no database migration)"
  technical_excellence:
    - "Type safety: TypeScript strict mode passes without any violations"
    - "State management: Immutable updates with signal .update()"
    - "Performance: Computed signals with automatic Angular caching"
    - "Testing: Unit tests cover sorting, shifting, reordering, edge cases, backward compatibility"
    - "Architecture: Clean separation of concerns (service vs component logic)"
