story_title: 'Add IMAGE Field Type for Visual Content Display'
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Implementation is functionally complete and follows architectural patterns, but lacks test coverage for new IMAGE field type functionality. Missing tests create risk for regressions during future development.'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'File type validation, size limits (5MB), and authentication enforced. Multer middleware correctly configured. Image URLs validated in metadata. No XSS risk from imageUrl (URL format validation).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Lazy loading implemented for images. CDN delivery from DO Spaces. Responsive image sizing with max-width constraints. 5MB file size limit prevents excessive storage costs.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Error handling implemented for upload failures and missing images. However, lack of tests means error paths are unvalidated. Loading states present in FormRendererComponent.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Code follows existing patterns (HEADING field type). Well-structured with separate preview components. However, missing JSDoc for some metadata properties reduces clarity. Test gap makes refactoring risky.'
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Alt text required (enforced in metadata defaults). Lazy loading attribute present. Images use semantic HTML with proper alt attributes. Screen reader compatible.'
