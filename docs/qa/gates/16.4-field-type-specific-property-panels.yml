schema: 1
story: "16.4"
story_title: "Field-Type Specific Property Panels"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All functional acceptance criteria met with high-quality implementation, but comprehensive test coverage is missing (no component tests, integration tests, or E2E tests for panel components)."

    severity: high
    finding: "Missing integration tests for metadata persistence to backend API"

    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing E2E tests for published form rendering with field-specific properties"

  # Functional implementation verified:
  # - AC 1: Dynamic panel loading ✓ (field-properties.component.ts:518-572)
  # - AC 2: HEADING panel ✓ (heading-properties-panel.component.ts)
  # - AC 3: IMAGE panel ✓ (image-properties-panel.component.ts)
  # - AC 4: TEXT_BLOCK panel ✓ (text-block-properties-panel.component.ts)
  # - AC 5: OPTIONS panel ✓ (options-properties-panel.component.ts)
  # - AC 6: FILE panel ✓ (file-properties-panel.component.ts)
  # - AC 7: GROUP panel ✓ (group-properties-panel.component.ts)
  # - AC 8: Metadata persistence ✓ (onPanelFieldChange handler)
  # - AC 9: Canvas preview updates ✓ (heading-preview.component.ts updated)
  # - AC 10: Published form rendering ✓ (getFieldCustomStyles method)

  # Test coverage gaps:
  # - Task 11.1: Component tests missing ✗
  # - Task 11.2: Integration tests missing ✗
  # - Task 11.3: E2E tests missing ✗

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No new security vulnerabilities introduced. Field-specific panels properly handle metadata without XSS risks."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dynamic panel loading efficient. OnPush change detection properly used. No performance concerns."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Zero test coverage means reliability cannot be verified. Metadata updates could fail silently without detection."

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Well-structured code with proper separation of concerns, but lack of tests makes refactoring risky and increases technical debt."
