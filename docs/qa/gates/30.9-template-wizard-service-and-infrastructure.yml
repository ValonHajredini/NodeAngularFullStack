    notes: "No security concerns. localStorage used appropriately for non-sensitive data. No XSS, SQL injection, or token storage issues."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Computed signals optimize re-renders. No heavy computations in hot paths. Lazy schema generation."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling present but could be more robust. Silent failures in localStorage (acceptable for draft data). No retry mechanism."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent separation of concerns. Comprehensive JSDoc. Type-safe with shared types. Testable architecture."
