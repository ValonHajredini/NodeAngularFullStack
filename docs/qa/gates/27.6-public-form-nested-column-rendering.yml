# Gate Decision: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
gate_decision: CONCERNS

# Reason for decision
decision_rationale: |
  Implementation is functionally COMPLETE with all 8 acceptance criteria met and good unit test coverage.
  However, CONCERNS exist due to:
  1. Missing E2E tests for critical responsive rendering behavior (AC4-AC6)
  2. Incomplete integration testing (Task 10 manual QA checklist)
  3. No backward compatibility unit tests (AC7)
  4. Significant template code duplication (444 lines) creates maintainability risk

  The gate is CONCERNS rather than FAIL because:
  - Core functionality works correctly (verified via unit tests)
  - Security and reliability requirements met
  - Test gaps can be addressed with 3.5 hours of additional testing work
  - Template duplication is a non-blocking maintainability issue that can be deferred

# Re-review Instructions
re_review:
  trigger: After developer completes E2E tests, Task 10 QA, and backward compatibility tests
  estimated_completion_date: TBD
  expected_outcome: PASS (with template duplication deferred to follow-up story)
  re_review_checklist:
    - "✓ Playwright E2E tests verify desktop horizontal layout (AC4)"
    - "✓ Playwright E2E tests verify mobile vertical stacking (AC5)"
    - "✓ Visual regression tests verify theme cascade (AC6)"
    - "✓ Unit tests verify backward compatibility (AC7)"
    - "✓ Task 10 manual QA checklist completed"
    - "✓ All acceptance criteria have test coverage"

# Final Summary
summary: |
  Story 27.6 (Public Form Nested Column Rendering) implements all 8 acceptance criteria successfully with
  clean TypeScript code and comprehensive unit test coverage. The implementation follows existing architectural
  patterns and maintains backward compatibility with legacy forms.

  However, CONCERNS exist due to:
  1. Missing E2E tests for critical responsive rendering behavior (AC4-AC6)
  2. Incomplete integration testing (Task 10 manual QA checklist)
  3. No backward compatibility unit tests (AC7)
  4. Significant template code duplication (444 lines) creates maintainability risk

  The gate decision is CONCERNS rather than FAIL because core functionality is correct and test gaps can
  be addressed with ~3.5 hours of additional work. Template duplication is a non-blocking issue that can
  be deferred to a follow-up refactoring story (Epic 27.8).

  Recommended next steps:
  1. Developer adds E2E tests for AC4-AC6 (2 hours)
  2. Developer completes Task 10 manual QA checklist (1 hour)
  3. Developer adds backward compatibility unit tests for AC7 (30 minutes)
  4. QA re-reviews → Gate becomes PASS
  5. Create follow-up story for template refactoring (deferred)
