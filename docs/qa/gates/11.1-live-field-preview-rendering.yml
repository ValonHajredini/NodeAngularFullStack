# Quality Gate Decision for Story 11.1
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "11.1"
story_title: "Live Field Preview Rendering"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is functionally complete with strong code quality, but Task 5 (unit tests) was not completed - zero test files exist for 10 new components. This is a required task that must be addressed before production deployment."

    finding: "Task 5 incomplete - Zero unit tests created for 10 new components (field-preview-renderer wrapper + 9 field preview components)"

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Existing form-canvas.component.spec.ts tests reference outdated selectors (.field-card, .empty-state) that no longer exist in updated template"

    severity: low
    finding: "Production bundle size exceeds budget by 488 bytes (750.49 kB vs 750.00 kB)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All form controls disabled (read-only), no user input handling, no XSS vulnerabilities, proper ARIA attributes"

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "OnPush change detection, proper signal usage, track by field.id. Minor bundle size overage acceptable. No performance tests for large forms (50+ fields)."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Cannot verify reliability without test coverage. Existing tests outdated and will fail."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component architecture, proper JSDoc documentation, follows Angular best practices, good separation of concerns. Minor DRY opportunity: validation indicator logic repeated across components."
