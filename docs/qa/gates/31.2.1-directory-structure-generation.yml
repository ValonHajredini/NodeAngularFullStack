    note: "Follow-up review - same issue persists, test failure rate worsened to 100% (0/6 passing). Root cause clearly identified: __dirname vs process.cwd() mismatch. One-line fix documented twice but not applied. Quality score decreased from 80 to 70 due to regression and process concerns."

# Additional context

  FOLLOW-UP REVIEW STATUS:
  ======================

  This is the SECOND consecutive review of this story. The exact same critical
  issue persists from the initial review, with the situation actually worsening:

  REGRESSION TIMELINE:
  - Initial review (2025-10-25): 50% integration test pass rate (3/6)
  - Follow-up review (2025-10-25): 0% integration test pass rate (0/6)
  - Root cause: Same path resolution issue + test artifacts in real project

  ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
  ====================
  File: packages/create-tool/src/config/directory-structure.ts
  Line: 127
  Code: const workspaceRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../../');

  Problem:
  - __dirname resolves to dist/config/ (compiled output location)
  - Integration tests change process.cwd() to temp directory
  - But __dirname still points to real project's dist directory
  - Generated paths reference real project, not temp test directory
  - Conflict detection finds old test-tool artifacts
  - All integration tests fail immediately

  THE FIX (documented twice):
  ===========================
  Replace: const workspaceRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../../');
  With:    const workspaceRoot = process.cwd();

  Why it works:
  - process.cwd() returns current working directory
  - Respects test environment's directory changes
  - Works in both production and test environments
  - Simpler logic (no path calculation)

  QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  ===================
  Code Quality: EXCELLENT
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
  - 100% unit test pass rate (44/44 tests)
  - Strong cross-platform compatibility
  - Clean architecture
  - Comprehensive error handling

  Test Infrastructure: FAILING
  - 0% integration test pass rate (0/6 tests)
  - Blocks CI/CD automation
  - Creates false confidence (manual works, tests fail)
  - Root cause well-documented but not addressed

  PROCESS CONCERNS:
  =================
  - Story marked "Ready for Review" without addressing previous CONCERNS
  - Two consecutive reviews identify same issue with same fix
  - Suggests communication gap or priority misalignment
  - Recommendation: Story owner and QA sync on test reliability priority

  GATE DECISION RATIONALE:
  ========================
  Gate remains CONCERNS (not escalated to FAIL) because:
  - Core functionality works in production
  - Unit tests provide strong foundation (100% pass)
  - Issue is test infrastructure, not code quality
  - Fix is trivial and well-documented (1 line)
  - Fixable in < 10 minutes total

  However, quality score decreased from 80 to 70 due to:
  - Test situation worsened (regression)
  - Issue documented twice without resolution
  - Process breakdown indicator

  NEXT STEPS:
  ===========
  1. Apply 1-line fix (5 minutes)
  2. Clean up test artifacts (2 minutes)
  3. Run tests (1 minute)
  4. All integration tests should pass
  5. Update Dev Agent Record
  6. Ready for Done status

  Total estimated time to resolve: ~10 minutes
