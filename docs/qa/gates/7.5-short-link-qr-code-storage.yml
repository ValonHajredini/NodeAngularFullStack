# Quality Gate Decision: Story 7.5
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "7.5"
story_title: "Add QR Code DigitalOcean Storage - Brownfield Addition"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is solid and follows established patterns, but integration tests are failing due to test environment auth setup (not code defects). Code quality is excellent with proper error handling and graceful degradation."

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix integration test auth setup before merging to ensure QR storage functionality is verified"

# Calculation: 100 - (10 × 1 MEDIUM) - (5 × 2 LOW) = 80, reduced to 70 due to test failures

  trace:

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "QR codes are intentionally public, no sensitive data exposed, proper path validation prevents traversal"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async storage upload, graceful degradation, indexed database column, no blocking operations"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Integration tests failing but due to test setup not code - graceful degradation implemented correctly"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation, follows avatar pattern, clean separation of concerns, strong TypeScript typing"

code_quality_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Follows established avatar upload pattern exactly - excellent pattern reuse"
    - "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all public methods"
    - "Graceful degradation: storage failures don't break short link creation (lines 380-404)"
    - "Proper separation: generateQRCode (PNG buffer), uploadQRCodeToStorage (storage), generateQRCodeDataUrl (backwards compat)"
    - "Database migration includes UP/DOWN, index, and column comments"
    - "TypeScript strict types prevent runtime errors"

  architecture_decisions:
    - "Storage URL (qrCodeUrl) as primary, base64 (qrCodeDataUrl) for backwards compatibility - smart transition strategy"
    - "QR code failures logged but don't block response - correct priority (link > QR)"
    - "Cleanup deletes from storage before database - prevents orphaned files"
