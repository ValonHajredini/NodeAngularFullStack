    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing unit tests for file upload-specific properties (acceptedTypes, maxFileSize, maxFiles form controls)"

    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "A11Y-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Accessibility concerns: missing ARIA labels, no aria-live for validation errors, no keyboard navigation hints for drag-and-drop"
    suggested_action: "Add ARIA attributes, aria-live regions for dynamic error messages, and keyboard shortcuts documentation"
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Missing edge case tests: options drag-drop reorder, multi-select toggle, type-specific default values"

evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 21
  risks_identified: 3
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]  # All ACs have implementation coverage
    ac_gaps: [7]  # AC7 (file upload) lacks comprehensive test coverage

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security posture. Input validation via reactive forms, regex pattern validation with ReDoS protection, no XSS vulnerabilities, proper type safety."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized with OnPush detection, 300ms debounce, signal-based reactivity, proper cleanup. No performance concerns."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling, null safety with optional chaining, boundary checks, proper state management, cleanup in ngOnDestroy."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented with JSDoc, clear method names, type safety with shared types, modern Angular patterns. 865 lines approaching complexity threshold but acceptable for comprehensive properties panel."
  accessibility:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Missing ARIA labels, no aria-live for errors, keyboard navigation hints needed for drag-and-drop. PrimeNG provides baseline but needs enhancement."

compliance_check:
  coding_standards: PASS  # JSDoc present, type safety, modern Angular patterns
  project_structure: PASS  # Follows standard structure
  testing_strategy: PASS  # 21 comprehensive unit tests, proper isolation
  all_acs_met: PASS  # All 10 acceptance criteria implemented

strengths:
  - "Exceptional use of modern Angular 20+ patterns (standalone, signals, effects, OnPush)"
  - "Custom validators (uniqueFieldNameValidator, regexPatternValidator) are robust"
  - "Excellent reactive forms architecture with proper debouncing and state management"
  - "Type-specific property visibility using computed field type detection methods"
  - "Drag-and-drop option reordering with CDK integration"
  - "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all public methods"
  - "Proper cleanup patterns (takeUntil, ngOnDestroy)"
  - "21 well-structured unit tests covering major functionality"
  - "Auto-generation of kebab-case field names with manual override support"
  - "Live canvas preview updates with 300ms debounce for optimal UX"

technical_debt:
  - severity: low
    description: "Component approaching 865 lines - consider splitting if file upload or conditional logic expands significantly"
    estimated_effort: "2-3 hours for refactoring if needed in future"
  - severity: low
    description: "Pre-existing project linting issues (1688 warnings/errors) not related to this story"
    estimated_effort: "N/A - tracked separately"
