story_title: "Remove Tailwind from Themeable Form Areas"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Core Tailwind replacement (Tasks 1-4) well-executed but incomplete in FormRendererComponent; critical testing tasks (5-12) completely deferred creates high production risk; 3 high-severity issues require resolution before production deployment."

# Critical issues requiring resolution
top_issues:
  - id: "IMPL-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Incomplete Tailwind color class replacement - 8 instances remain in FormRendererComponent (lines 50, 99, 576, 915, 948, 961, 964, 1069)"
    suggested_action: "Complete Tailwind→Theme class replacement: footer/placeholder text → .theme-text-secondary, read-more button → .theme-button-primary, image placeholders → design decision needed (themeable vs UI chrome)"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Zero test coverage - Tasks 11-12 completely deferred (no visual regression tests, no responsive tests, no manual testing)"
    suggested_action: "Write minimum 20 test cases covering: Tailwind class absence, theme class presence, forms without themes, layout utilities preserved; execute manual testing checklist (11 items)"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "AC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Acceptance Criteria 4-6 not validated - no evidence of visual regression testing, field type rendering, or responsive behavior validation"
    suggested_action: "Execute validation for AC 4 (forms without themes), AC 5 (all field types with theme), AC 6 (mobile/tablet/desktop responsive behavior); document results with screenshots/test output"

# Risk summary
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 3  # Incomplete implementation, zero tests, unvalidated ACs
    medium: 0
    low: 0
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Complete Tailwind color class replacement in FormRendererComponent before production"
      - "Write visual regression test suite (minimum 20 test cases) before production"
      - "Execute manual testing checklist and validate AC 4, 5, 6 with documented evidence"
    monitor:
      - "Verify theme performance with complex forms (100+ fields) in production (carry-forward from Story 23.3)"
      - "Consider E2E tests for responsive breakpoint validation in future sprint (carry-forward from Story 23.3)"

# Quality metrics
quality_score: 60
# Calculation: 100 - (20 × 0 FAILs) - (10 × 3 CONCERNS) - (10 deferred testing) = 60
# Deduction breakdown:
#   - 30 points: 3 high-severity CONCERNS (10 points each)
#   - 10 points: Testing tasks completely deferred
expires: "2025-10-31T00:00:00Z"  # 2 weeks freshness window

# Evidence of comprehensive review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 0  # Zero tests written
  risks_identified: 3  # All high severity
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3]  # AC 1-3 mostly met (with incomplete replacements)
    ac_gaps: [4, 5, 6]  # AC 4-6 not validated

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CSS class replacements only - no XSS vectors, no auth/authz changes, no executable code; inherits security validation from Story 23.3 theme utility classes"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance - CSS variables browser-native and fast, reduced specificity conflicts, 300ms transitions acceptable, pre-existing bundle warnings unrelated to story"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Incomplete Tailwind replacement may cause visual inconsistencies; zero test coverage creates regression risk for future changes; forms without themes untested"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, proper theme utility class usage, no new technical debt; however, lack of tests makes future refactoring risky"

# Recommendations for immediate action (blocking)
recommendations:
  immediate:  # Must fix before production
    - action: "Complete Tailwind color class replacement"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/form-renderer.component.html:50,99,576,915,948,961,964,1069"]
      rationale: "Theme styles won't apply to footer links, placeholder text, image captions, read-more buttons without replacement; visual inconsistency when theme active"
    - action: "Write visual regression test suite (Task 11)"
      refs: ["docs/stories/23.4.remove-tailwind-from-themeable-form-areas.md:126-145"]
      rationale: "Zero test coverage unacceptable for CSS changes affecting all form rendering; Story 23.3 had 65 tests, Story 23.4 has zero; cannot verify forms without themes render correctly"
    - action: "Execute manual testing checklist (Task 12)"
      refs: ["docs/stories/23.4.remove-tailwind-from-themeable-form-areas.md:146-155"]
      rationale: "No evidence of visual QA, responsive behavior validation, or field type testing; AC 4, 5, 6 unvalidated"
  future:  # Can be addressed later (non-blocking)
    - action: "Consider E2E tests for full responsive validation"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/styles/theme-variables.css:378-432"]
      rationale: "Karma has limitations for media query testing - E2E would provide comprehensive coverage across breakpoints (carry-forward from Story 23.3)"

# Test architecture assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage_summary: "CRITICAL GAP - Zero test cases written; Tasks 11-12 completely deferred"
  test_levels:
    unit: "0 test cases (expected: minimum 20 for visual regression)"
    integration: "Not applicable (CSS changes only)"
    e2e: "Recommended for responsive validation (not blocking)"
  test_quality: "N/A (no tests written)"
  test_maintainability: "N/A (no tests written)"
  comparison_to_dependencies: "Story 23.3 had 65 comprehensive test cases with 100% quality score; Story 23.4 has zero tests - significant quality regression"

# Code quality assessment
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Correct application of theme utility classes from Story 23.3 dependency"
    - "Layout utilities properly preserved (flex, grid, padding, margin, sizing)"
    - "Semantic colors appropriately preserved (error states, delete buttons)"
    - "Active step tab styling uses CSS variables for theme compatibility"
    - "TypeScript typecheck passes, frontend build succeeds"
    - "Clean code structure, no new technical debt"
  areas_for_improvement:
    - "Complete Tailwind color class replacement (8 instances remain)"
    - "Add comprehensive test coverage (currently zero tests)"
    - "Validate all acceptance criteria with documented evidence"
    - "Execute manual testing checklist before production deployment"
