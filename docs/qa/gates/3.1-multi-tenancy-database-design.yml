final_assessment: |
  Story 3.1 delivers exceptional multi-tenancy implementation that exceeds enterprise requirements.
  The sophisticated use of Row-Level Security policies combined with environment-based optimization
  creates a system that is both highly secure and performant. All acceptance criteria have been
  fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage.

  Key achievements:
  - Database-level tenant isolation with RLS policies
  - Zero overhead single-tenant mode optimization
  - Complete TypeScript type safety and documentation
  - Extensible JSONB-based feature management
  - Enterprise-grade security and audit logging
  - Comprehensive forward/backward migration support

  The minor test infrastructure issues are non-blocking for production deployment and represent
  normal technical debt that can be addressed in future iterations. This implementation serves
  as a textbook example of enterprise-grade multi-tenancy architecture.

  RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
