# Notes
notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation demonstrating modern Angular 20+ best practices.
  The component showcases:
  - Proper use of signals for reactive state management
  - Modern inject() pattern for dependency injection
  - Comprehensive subscription cleanup preventing memory leaks
  - Clean separation of concerns with distinct UI states
  - Responsive CSS Grid implementation
  - Complete test coverage (12 test cases)

  The only minor issue is a documentation discrepancy in the story dev notes,
  which does not affect code functionality. The implementation correctly uses
  tool.tool_id (snake_case) matching the shared types, while the story examples
  incorrectly show tool.toolId (camelCase).

  Component is production-ready and can proceed to Done status.
