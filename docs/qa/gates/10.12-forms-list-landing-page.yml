nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All API calls use authenticated endpoints. Input validation (maxlength, URL pattern) on form settings. No XSS vulnerabilities (Angular + PrimeNG). No new auth logic."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client-side search with 300ms debounce, computed signals for efficient filtering. Lazy route loading. OnPush change detection. Optimized for target use case (<100 forms)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all API failures. Loading states, empty states, success messages. 500ms navigation delay for UX smoothness."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JSDoc comments on all public methods. Signal-based state. Clean component structure (single responsibility). Angular control flow syntax. TypeScript strict mode. Zero code duplication."
