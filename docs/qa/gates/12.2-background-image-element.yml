  security:
    status: FAIL
    notes: 'Cannot assess - no implementation code available for review. Story requires image URL validation and file upload security (XSS prevention, MIME type checking, CSP for external images)'
  performance:
    status: FAIL
    notes: 'Cannot assess - no implementation code available. Story mentions performance considerations (large images, lazy loading) but no evidence of implementation'

    status: FAIL
    notes: 'Cannot assess - no code available for review. Story has excellent documentation but implementation status unknown'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Change story status from "Approved" to "In Progress" or "Review" to match actual state'

    - action: 'Populate File List section with all modified/created files'

    - action: 'Complete Dev Agent Record with model used, debug log refs, and completion notes'

risk_assessment:

  test_coverage: none
  security_risk: high
  performance_risk: medium
  notes: |
    Story appears to be in planning/approved stage, not implementation or review stage.
    No code changes detected. Cannot perform comprehensive QA review without implementation.

    When implementation is complete, key risk areas to assess:
    - XSS vulnerabilities from image URLs (javascript: protocol injection)
    - MIME type validation bypass attacks
    - File size limits and DoS prevention
    - CSP compatibility with external image sources
    - Performance impact of large background images on form rendering
    - Base64 data URL size limits in form schema

next_steps:
  - Complete implementation following the detailed task breakdown in story
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
  - Run all tests and verify they pass
  - Update story status to "Review"
  - Populate File List and Dev Agent Record
  - Re-submit for QA review
