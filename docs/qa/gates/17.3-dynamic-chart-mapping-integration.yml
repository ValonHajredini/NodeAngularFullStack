# Quality Gate Decision
# Story 17.3: Dynamic Chart Type Mapping and Integration

schema: 1
story: "17.3"
story_title: "Dynamic Chart Type Mapping and Integration - Brownfield Addition"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 9 acceptance criteria met with excellent implementation quality. Comprehensive chart type compatibility matrix, dynamic chart resolution logic, and backward compatibility all verified. TypeScript compilation passes. Minor test coverage gap is pre-existing technical debt, not introduced by this story."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Client-side preferences only, no sensitive data, no user input handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Computed signal-based reactivity ensures minimal re-renders. Chart type change only triggers single field card update. Signal trigger pattern optimal."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Defensive coding with isCompatibleChartType() validation prevents incompatible chart/data pairings. @default fallback handles edge cases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code follows established patterns from Stories 17.1 and 17.2. Clear separation of concerns with compatibility matrix, defaults, and selector logic."
