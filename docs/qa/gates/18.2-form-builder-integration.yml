# All Pre-Implementation Issues Resolved
resolved_issues:
  - id: "REQ-001"
    severity: medium
    original_finding: "Validation timing ambiguity - AC 7 states 'validates metadata before saving' but doesn't specify when validation triggers or how errors are presented."
    resolution: "RESOLVED - 3-tier validation strategy documented: (1) Immediate inline warnings (non-blocking, orange text), (2) Save button disabled with tooltip if invalid, (3) Publish validation blocks with comprehensive error message. Follows ImagePropertiesPanel pattern (lines 55-57) with enhanced UX."
    resolution_location: "story-18.2:779-808"
    verification_status: "VERIFIED - Matches existing ImagePropertiesPanel validation pattern"

  - id: "REQ-002"
    severity: medium
    original_finding: "Error handling strategy undefined for DigitalOcean Spaces upload failures. No retry logic or user feedback mechanism defined."
    resolution: "RESOLVED - ImageUploadComponent error handling pattern documented with specific error messages, no automatic retry (manual retry only), timeout handling (2 minutes), and DO Spaces-specific errors (403/413/500). Partial uploads not applicable (atomic single-image uploads)."
    resolution_location: "story-18.2:812-854"
    verification_status: "VERIFIED - References ImageUploadComponent implementation (lines 329-353)"

  - id: "REQ-003"
    severity: medium
    original_finding: "ImageUploadComponent integration details missing. How to invoke it (modal dialog? inline widget? file picker?), batch upload support, progress display, URL callback mechanism."
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Inline widget pattern documented (not modal), one-at-a-time uploads (not batch), progress display specified (spinner + text), event emitter pattern with complete code example. References UnifiedFieldEditorModalComponent (lines 162-173, 1403-1436)."
    resolution_location: "story-18.2:858-924"
    verification_status: "VERIFIED - Complete integration code example provided"

  - id: "CLARITY-001"
    severity: low
    original_finding: "Default metadata values inconsistency between AC 4 and AC 8. AC 4 defines 'columns?: 2 | 3 | 4' (optional, no default), but AC 8 specifies 'columns: 4' (default: 4)."
    resolution: "RESOLVED - AC 4 interface definition updated with explicit default value comments: 'columns?: 2 | 3 | 4; // Default: 4'. FormBuilderService initialization code documented with explicit default values."
    resolution_location: "story-18.2:928-960"
    verification_status: "VERIFIED - Consistency rule specified"

  - id: "IMPL-001"
    severity: low
    original_finding: "Image reordering implementation details missing. AC 4 mentions drag-and-drop but doesn't specify technical approach (Angular CDK Drag-Drop?)."
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Angular CDK Drag-Drop specified (already in project for OptionsPropertiesPanel), complete code example with moveItemInArray helper function, visual feedback documented. References OptionsPropertiesPanel (lines 211-216)."
    resolution_location: "story-18.2:964-1012"
    verification_status: "VERIFIED - Matches OptionsPropertiesPanel drag-drop implementation exactly"

    medium: 0 # All 3 medium issues resolved
    low: 0 # All 2 low issues resolved
  recommendations:
    immediate: [] # All concerns addressed
    monitor:
      - "Consider adding image upload progress indicator (percentage bar, not just spinner) - nice-to-have enhancement"
      - "Consider batch image upload support for better UX - future enhancement"

# Post-Clarification Requirements Traceability

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Image optimization (resize to 800px), DO Spaces URLs (not base64), maximum 10 images recommended with configurable limit. Performance considerations adequate."
  reliability:
    status: PASS # UPGRADED from CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling strategy now fully documented - ImageUploadComponent error handling pattern with user-facing messages, manual retry, timeout handling, and DO Spaces-specific error codes."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS

  - "Error handling strategy fully documented with specific error messages and user feedback"
  - "Inline widget integration pattern clearly specified with event emitter code example"
  - "Default value inconsistency resolved with explicit comments in interface definition"
  - "Drag-drop reordering approach specified with Angular CDK pattern matching existing implementation"
  - "Strong dependency verification - Story 18.1 complete and reviewed (PASS gate)"
  - "Comprehensive DoD with 35-item checklist"

  - "Backward compatibility addressed with graceful degradation"
  - "13 comprehensive acceptance criteria now fully clear and actionable"

# Post-Clarification Quality Score
quality_score: 96
# Calculation: 100 - (0 medium issues × 6 points) - (0 low issues × 1 point) - (2 future enhancements × 2 points) = 96
# Future enhancements (progress bar, batch upload) are nice-to-have improvements, not blocking concerns
# Score upgraded from 82 (pre-clarification) to 96 (post-clarification)
