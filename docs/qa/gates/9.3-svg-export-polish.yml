# Quality Gate Decision - Story 9.3: SVG Export & Polish
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "9.3"
story_title: "SVG Export & Polish"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Functionally complete with good code quality, but had critical test coverage gaps (now addressed). Pre-existing test infrastructure issues prevent full validation."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

  active: false

# Critical issues identified
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "SVG export and localStorage persistence tests were initially missing for critical ACs"
    suggested_action: "Tests have been added during review (21 new tests). Dev must verify execution once test infrastructure is fixed."
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Pre-existing test infrastructure issues blocking test execution (TypeScript errors in unrelated test files)"
    suggested_action: "Fix test infrastructure issues in separate ticket - affects entire test suite, not just this story"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-003"
    severity: low
    finding: "New components (help-panel, guide-overlay, export-options) have minimal unit tests"
    suggested_action: "Consider expanding component test coverage for better maintainability"
    suggested_owner: dev

# Quality scoring

    notes: "No security concerns. localStorage usage appropriate, no XSS risks, proper input validation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-managed with debouncing, command history limits, and optimization levels. Consider adding monitoring for large drawings."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling for localStorage quota, corrupted data, and SVG validation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, JSDoc comments, TypeScript strict mode, and proper separation of concerns."
