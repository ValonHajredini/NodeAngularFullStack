    status: PASS
    notes: "Cascading deletes properly configured, rollback migration tested, triggers reuse existing functions. No circular dependencies."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc coverage, clean type hierarchy, migration follows project conventions, clear separation of concerns."
