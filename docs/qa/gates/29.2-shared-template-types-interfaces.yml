    status: PASS
    notes: "Type-only definitions with no runtime code, database access, or user input handling. No security surface."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Strong typing with discriminated unions prevents runtime type errors. Backward compatibility verified."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc documentation (100% coverage), clear structure, follows established patterns from forms.types.ts and theme.types.ts."

# Implementation highlights
strengths:
  - "Discriminated union pattern enables compile-time type narrowing without runtime checks"
  - "Comprehensive JSDoc with real-world usage examples for all 10 interfaces and 1 enum"
  - "Helper types (CreateFormTemplateRequest, UpdateFormTemplateRequest, TemplateFilterParams) provide clean API contracts"
  - "Proper reuse of existing FormSchema type maintains consistency"
  - "CamelCase naming aligns with TypeScript conventions (contrasts with database snake_case)"
  - "Zero breaking changes to existing shared types (FormSchema, FormTheme, User)"
  - "Build and typecheck pass successfully across all workspaces"

# Architecture notes for downstream stories
downstream_guidance:

    - "Transform database snake_case columns to TypeScript camelCase properties"
    - "Use JSON.stringify() for business_logic_config JSONB column storage"

  story_29_4_service:
    - "Implement type guard utilities (isInventoryConfig, etc.) for runtime type checking"
    - "Add runtime validation for business logic configs using Zod"
    - "Validate field references exist in templateSchema.fields[]"
  story_29_5_controller:
    - "Use CreateFormTemplateRequest for POST /templates endpoint"
    - "Use UpdateFormTemplateRequest for PATCH /templates/:id endpoint"
    - "Use TemplateFilterParams for GET /templates query parameters"
