gate_decision_rationale: |
  This story receives a FAIL gate decision based on the following critical findings:

  **Critical Test Failures (High Severity):**
  - All 3 backend test suites fail with TypeScript compilation errors
  - Service constructor signature mismatch between implementation and tests
  - Integration tests cannot run due to missing exports
  - Repository tests have type errors throughout

  **Missing Test Coverage (Medium Severity):**
  - No unit tests for custom name validation logic (AC #2)
  - No unit tests for QR code generation (AC #3)
  - Frontend component tests not updated for new features
  - Cannot verify backward compatibility or regression (AC #4, #10)

  **Implementation Quality (Positive Notes):**
  - Code implementation appears comprehensive and well-structured
  - Proper JSDoc documentation throughout
  - Security considerations addressed (reserved words, validation, rate limiting)
  - Follow existing architectural patterns (reactive forms, service layer, repository pattern)
  - QR code library choice is appropriate

  **The Fundamental Problem:**
  Despite the story being marked "Ready for QA/Review" and the Implementation Summary claiming "TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)", this is demonstrably false. Running the test suite reveals extensive compilation failures.

  **Quality Bar:**
  A story cannot receive PASS or even CONCERNS when:
  1. The test suite does not compile
  2. Zero tests are passing
  3. Core functionality is untested
  4. Manual testing checklist is incomplete

  **Path Forward:**
  1. Fix all TypeScript compilation errors in tests
  2. Ensure all existing tests pass
  3. Add missing test coverage for new features
  4. Complete manual testing checklist
  5. Request re-review

  This is not a rejection of the feature implementation itself, which appears solid. Rather, it's a requirement that the engineering quality standards be met before production deployment.
