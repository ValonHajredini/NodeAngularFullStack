# Gate decision rationale
gate_decision_rationale: |
  The implementation quality is excellent with proper architectural patterns, comprehensive documentation,
  and thorough service-layer unit testing (25 tests covering all scenarios). However, Acceptance Criteria #12
  explicitly requires component tests for RowLayoutSidebarComponent to verify UI interactions (checkboxes,
  keyboard modifiers, batch toolbar, published mode).

  Gate status is CONCERNS (not FAIL) because:
  1. The functionality is fully implemented and working correctly
  2. Service-layer logic is comprehensively tested (25 tests, ≥90% coverage)
  3. TypeScript compilation passes for Story 28.2 code
  4. No security, performance, or architectural concerns identified
  5. Missing component tests are the only gap preventing PASS status

  This is a non-blocking concern that should be addressed before production deployment. The team should
  decide whether to:
  - Complete component tests now before marking story Done
  - Accept for MVP with commitment to add tests in next sprint
  - Document as technical debt with plan to address before production release
