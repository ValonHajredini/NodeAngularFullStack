nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional security with multi-layer validation (JWT → published → rate limiting → field validation → XSS). Database-level rate limiting (10/hour per IP), comprehensive field validation, XSS protection via validator.escape(), SQL injection prevention, privacy-first IP masking."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient pagination (LIMIT/OFFSET), database-level rate limiting (single query), CSV export limited to 10K records, field truncation in lists. Test response times: 2-50ms."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with specific codes (VALIDATION_ERROR, RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, TOKEN_EXPIRED). Type-safe validation for all field types. Observable-based async patterns."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization (routes → controllers → repositories). Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. TypeScript strict mode. Shared types via @nodeangularfullstack/shared."
