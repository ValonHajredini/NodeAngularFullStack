nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Step validation middleware validates UUIDs, uniqueness, sequential order. XSS protection maintained. Field-step reference validation ensures referential integrity.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Computed signals (visibleFields, visibleRows) efficiently filter data. Step tab rendering optimized with track step.id. No performance regressions detected.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling for cross-step drag prevention, invalid step ID validation. Backward compatibility with single-page forms maintained. Zero breaking changes.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent signals-based architecture. Clear separation of concerns. Comprehensive inline documentation. Type-safe FieldPosition with stepId property. All 15 tests follow best practices.'
