# NodeAngularFullStack Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable 40% time savings on simple projects and 15% time savings to MVP on complex projects
- Achieve 500+ GitHub stars within 6 months indicating strong community adoption
- Create a production-ready fullstack foundation that eliminates infrastructure setup burden
- Provide configurable multi-tenancy toggle for universal business model adaptability
- Establish quality-first development foundation with security, performance, and UX standards built-in
- Build active contributor community of 20+ developers for sustainable open source ecosystem
- Enable developers to focus on core business logic rather than repetitive boilerplate setup

### Background Context

Developers consistently lose 40-60% of initial project time to repetitive infrastructure setup including authentication systems, database configuration, API documentation, and containerization. This "boilerplate burden" forces focus on technical plumbing instead of core business logic and user experience innovation that creates brilliant products.

NodeAngularFullStack addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive fullstack boilerplate with production-ready infrastructure from day one. Unlike fragmented solutions that address only single aspects, this template integrates JWT authentication, optional multi-tenancy, Docker containerization, and professional-grade testing tools with quality standards that serve junior developers, startup founders, and DevOps engineers simultaneously.
