## What to Do Next

### For Developers

1. **Read Epic 23 Document**
   - Location: `docs/prd/epic-23-complete-theme-system.md`
   - Understand rollback strategy and rebuild approach

2. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/epic-23-theme-system-correction
   ```

3. **Start with Story 23.1 (Rollback)**
   - Delete Epic 22 admin theme files
   - Revert Epic 21 template changes
   - Verify Epic 20 still works

4. **Follow Story Sequence**
   - 23.1 → 23.2 → 23.3 + 23.4 (parallel) → 23.5 → 23.6 → 23.7

### For Product Manager

1. **Monitor Progress**
   - Track story completion daily
   - Ensure quality gates pass after each story

2. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Explain why rollback was necessary
   - Highlight improved timeline (8-10 days clean vs. 10-12+ days patching)

3. **Final Approval**
   - Review E2E test results
   - Approve merge to main branch

## Files to Rollback (Story 23.1)

### Delete Completely

```bash
rm -rf apps/web/src/app/features/admin/pages/theme-designer/
rm -rf apps/web/src/app/features/admin/pages/theme-management/
rm -rf apps/web/src/app/features/admin/components/theme-preview/
rm -rf apps/web/src/app/features/admin/components/theme-export-dialog/
rm -rf apps/web/src/app/features/admin/components/theme-import-dialog/
rm apps/web/src/app/features/admin/services/theme-designer.service.ts
rm apps/api/src/routes/admin-themes.routes.ts
rm apps/api/src/controllers/admin-themes.controller.ts
```

### Revert to Previous State

```bash
git checkout origin/main -- apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/form-canvas.component.ts
git checkout origin/main -- apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/form-renderer.component.html
```

### Update Manually

- `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/admin.routes.ts` (remove theme routes)
- `apps/web/src/app/layouts/main-layout/navigation.service.ts` (remove theme nav)

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All 4 user issues resolved
- ✅ Non-admin users can create custom themes
- ✅ Theme rendering pixel-perfect everywhere
- ✅ Zero regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ E2E tests pass 100%
- ✅ Performance: Theme creation <2s, preview <300ms

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Rollback causes regressions  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing after Story 23.1

**Timeline Risk:** Underestimate modal wizard complexity  
**Mitigation:** 6 hours allocated (generous), can extend to 8

**Rollback Plan:** Restore Epic 20 state, disable custom themes, no data loss
