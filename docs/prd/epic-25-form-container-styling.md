# Epic 25: Form Container Styling - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Add comprehensive form container styling controls to the theme designer modal, allowing users to
customize the visual appearance of the p-card wrapper element (background, borders, shadows,
alignment, opacity) that wraps public forms. This enhancement will give form creators full control
over their form's container presentation across the form editor preview and public form rendering.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current Relevant Functionality:**
  - 5-step theme designer modal with existing steps: Colors, Background, Typography, Field Styling,
    Preview Elements
  - Theme configuration stored in `ThemeProperties` interface with responsive desktop/mobile support
  - `ThemeDesignerModalService` manages theme state using Angular signals
  - `ThemePreviewService` applies CSS variables in real-time to preview changes
  - Public form renderer (`FormRendererComponent`) applies theme styles to rendered forms
  - Form builder preview shows theme changes in real-time

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Angular 20+ (standalone components, signals)
  - PrimeNG 17+ UI components (Dialog, Stepper, ColorPicker, Slider, InputNumber, etc.)
  - TypeScript with strict mode
  - CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
  - Shared TypeScript types (`@nodeangularfullstack/shared`)

- **Integration Points:**
  - Theme designer modal stepper system (currently 5 steps: 0-4)
  - `ThemeDesignerModalService` for state management
  - `ThemePreviewService` for real-time CSS variable application
  - `FormTheme` interface and `ThemeProperties` type definitions
  - Public form renderer component
  - Form builder preview component

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Added:**

Add a new **6th step** to the theme designer modal titled "Form Container Styling" that provides
controls for:

1. **Container Background:**
   - Solid color picker
   - Image upload with preview
   - Background size/position controls

2. **Border Controls:**
   - Border enable/disable toggle
   - Border width slider (0-10px)
   - Border color picker
   - Border radius slider (0-50px)
   - Border style dropdown (solid, dashed, dotted)

3. **Box Shadow:**
   - Shadow enable/disable toggle
   - Shadow intensity slider
   - Shadow color picker with alpha
   - Predefined shadow presets (subtle, medium, strong, custom)

4. **Container Layout:**
   - Horizontal alignment (left, center, right)
   - Vertical alignment (top, center, bottom)
   - Container max-width input (with responsive presets)

5. **Transparency & Effects:**
   - Container opacity slider (0-100%)
   - Backdrop blur enable/disable
   - Backdrop blur intensity slider

**How It Integrates:**

1. **Theme Designer Modal:** Add new step panel at index 5 in the stepper
2. **Shared Types:** Extend `ThemeProperties` interface with new container styling properties
3. **Service Layer:** Add getter/setter methods in `ThemeDesignerModalService` for container
   properties
4. **Preview Service:** Extend `ThemePreviewService` to apply container CSS variables
5. **Form Renderer:** Update `FormRendererComponent` to apply container styles to p-card element
6. **Form Builder Preview:** Ensure container styles apply to preview canvas

**Success Criteria:**

1. Users can customize all container visual properties through intuitive UI controls
2. Changes preview in real-time within the theme designer modal
3. Saved theme correctly applies container styles to public forms
4. Container styles work correctly on both desktop and mobile viewports
5. Existing theme functionality remains unchanged (no regressions)
6. All controls follow existing theme designer UI patterns and accessibility standards

## Stories

### Story 1: Add Container Styling Step UI Component

Create the new 6th step component for the theme designer modal with all visual controls for
container customization (background, borders, shadows, alignment, transparency). This includes the
component structure, UI layout, form controls, and integration with the theme designer modal
stepper.

**Key Deliverables:**

- `ContainerStylingStepComponent` with all controls grouped logically
- Real-time preview within the step component
- Follows existing step component patterns (ColorStepComponent, BackgroundStepComponent, etc.)
- Responsive 2-column layout for controls
- PrimeNG component integration (ColorPicker, Slider, InputNumber, Select, etc.)

### Story 2: Extend Theme Types and Service State Management

Update the shared type definitions and theme service to support container styling properties. This
includes extending the `ThemeProperties` interface, adding getter/setter methods to
`ThemeDesignerModalService`, and ensuring proper state synchronization.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Extended `ThemeProperties` interface with container styling properties
- Getter/setter methods in `ThemeDesignerModalService` for all new properties
- Default values for container styling properties
- Proper signal-based reactivity for container state changes
- TypeScript type safety across frontend and backend

### Story 3: Apply Container Styling to Form Renderer and Preview

Implement the CSS variable application and DOM updates to apply container styling to both the form
builder preview and public form rendering. This includes updating `ThemePreviewService` for
real-time preview and `FormRendererComponent` for public form display.

**Key Deliverables:**

- `ThemePreviewService` extended with container CSS variables
- CSS variable mapping for all container properties
- `FormRendererComponent` updated to apply container styles to p-card wrapper
- Form builder preview canvas updated to show container styles
- Responsive behavior for container styles on mobile viewports
- Cross-browser compatibility verification (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing theme designer steps (Steps 1-5) remain unchanged
- [x] Existing `FormTheme` database schema can accommodate new properties (JSONB `themeConfig`
      column)
- [x] Theme API endpoints require no changes (new properties are additive within `themeConfig`)
- [x] Existing published themes continue to work without container styling (graceful degradation)
- [x] UI changes follow existing theme designer modal patterns and styling
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (CSS variable updates only)
- [x] No breaking changes to theme export/import functionality

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks

1. **Risk:** Complex CSS combinations (background images + shadows + blur) may cause performance
   issues on lower-end devices
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Limit backdrop blur to modern browsers only (feature detection)
     - Add performance warnings for complex effect combinations
     - Test on low-end mobile devices during Story 3
     - Provide "Performance Mode" toggle if needed

2. **Risk:** Container styling may conflict with existing form field styles or break responsive
   layouts
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use CSS custom properties with proper specificity and scoping
     - Test all existing themes with new container styling applied
     - Ensure container styles are scoped to p-card wrapper only
     - Comprehensive responsive testing on multiple viewport sizes

3. **Risk:** Image upload for container background may introduce storage/bandwidth concerns
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Reuse existing image upload infrastructure from background step
     - Apply same file size limits and validation
     - Consider lazy loading for background images
     - Add compression for uploaded images

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. **Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
   - Feature flag to hide Container Styling step from theme designer modal
   - Default container styling properties to empty/null values
   - No database rollback needed (JSONB is additive)

2. **Full Rollback (< 30 minutes):**
   - Revert Story 3 commits (remove CSS variable application)
   - Revert Story 1 commits (remove UI component)
   - Keep Story 2 type definitions (harmless if unused)
   - Re-deploy frontend bundle

3. **Data Integrity:**
   - No database migration required for rollback
   - Existing themes unaffected
   - New themes with container styling gracefully degrade (styles ignored)

## Definition of Done

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing theme designer modal running Angular 20+ with PrimeNG 17+
  and Angular Signals
- Integration points:
  - Theme designer modal stepper (add new step at index 5)
  - `ThemeDesignerModalService` (add getter/setter methods with signals)
  - `ThemePreviewService` (add CSS variable mapping)
  - `FormRendererComponent` (apply container styles to p-card)
  - `ThemeProperties` interface in shared package (extend with new properties)
- Existing patterns to follow:
  - Follow `ColorStepComponent`, `BackgroundStepComponent`, `StylingStepComponent` patterns for step
    UI
  - Use Angular signals for reactive state (not Observables)
  - Use PrimeNG components for all form controls (ColorPicker, Slider, InputNumber, Select, etc.)
  - Follow existing CSS custom property naming conventions (--theme-form-\*)
  - Follow existing 2-column layout pattern for controls
  - Use `@nodeangularfullstack/shared` for type definitions
- Critical compatibility requirements:
  - No changes to database schema (JSONB is flexible)
  - No changes to API endpoints (new properties are additive)
  - Existing themes must continue to work unchanged
  - Container styling must work across form editor, preview, and public rendering
- Each story must include verification that existing theme designer functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive form container styling
controls that integrate seamlessly with the existing 5-step theme designer workflow."
