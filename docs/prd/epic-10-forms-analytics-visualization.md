submissions in a tabular format with sorting, filtering, and pagination. Add navigation from the
forms list to this new page.

**Key Features:**

- New route: `/app/tools/form-builder/:id/analytics`
- PrimeNG DataTable with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Display submission metadata: date, masked IP, field values
- Navigation link from forms list component
- Responsive layout with full-width and container modes
- Loading states and error handling

**Technical Details:**

- Component: `FormAnalyticsComponent` (standalone)
- Service: `FormAnalyticsService` for data fetching
- Uses existing `FormsApiService` methods
- Follows existing authentication patterns
- Implements Angular signals for reactive state

### Story 2: Data Visualization & Statistics Engine

**Goal:** Build the statistics calculation engine and visual charts

**Description:** Implement analytics calculations and data visualizations using PrimeNG Chart
components. Users can view field-specific statistics and customize which charts to display.

**Key Features:**

- Analytics service calculates field-specific statistics
- Chart components: bar charts (choice fields), line charts (trends), pie charts (distributions)
- Customizable dashboard with chart selection
- Real-time statistics updates when filters change
- Support for numeric, date, and choice-based field analytics

**Technical Details:**

- Service: `StatisticsEngineService` for calculations
- Components: `BarChartComponent`, `LineChartComponent`, `PieChartComponent`
- Uses PrimeNG Chart library (wrapper for Chart.js)
- Implements computed signals for reactive charts
- Client-side aggregation with caching

### Story 3: Enhanced CSV Export & Data Filtering

**Goal:** Extend CSV export with filtering and field selection

**Description:** Enhance the existing CSV export functionality to support field selection, date
range filtering, and handle large datasets efficiently. Add advanced filtering capabilities to the
submissions table.

**Key Features:**

- Export configuration UI: select fields, date range, filters
- Advanced filtering in submissions table
- Bulk actions: export selected, delete selected (admins)
- Streaming CSV export for large datasets
- Progress indicators for long-running exports

**Technical Details:**

- Extend `GET /api/forms/:id/submissions/export` endpoint
- Add query parameters: `fields`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `filters`
- Implement streaming response for large datasets
- Client-side: export dialog component with field checkboxes
- Server-side: pagination/streaming for 10,000+ records

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] **Existing APIs remain unchanged** - New analytics endpoints are additions, not modifications
- [x] **Database schema changes are backward compatible** - No migrations required, uses existing
      `form_submissions` table
- [x] **UI changes follow existing patterns** - PrimeNG components, Tailwind CSS, Angular signals
- [x] **Performance impact is minimal** - Analytics queries use database indexes, results cached
      client-side

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk

Large submission datasets (10,000+ records) could cause performance degradation in visualizations,
table rendering, and CSV exports.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Pagination and Lazy Loading**
   - Submissions table uses server-side pagination (default: 50 per page)
   - Virtual scrolling for large result sets
   - Lazy load chart data only when chart is visible

2. **Server-Side Aggregation**
   - Statistics calculations performed in PostgreSQL using aggregate functions
   - Database indexes on `form_schema_id`, `submitted_at` columns
   - Query result caching with in-memory cache (optional Redis)

3. **Streaming CSV Export**
   - Use Node.js streams for CSV generation
   - Send response in chunks to avoid memory overflow
   - Progress indicators show export status

4. **Loading States and UX**
   - Skeleton loaders during data fetch
   - Progress bars for long operations
   - Disable interactions during processing

### Rollback Plan

- Analytics routes can be disabled via feature flag in environment config
- No database migrations required, so rollback is immediate
- Existing submission viewing (`getSubmissions`) and export (`exportSubmissions`) remain functional
- Remove analytics route from Angular routing config to disable feature

components) and Express.js with PostgreSQL**.

**Integration Points:**

- Existing API endpoints: `GET /api/forms/:id/submissions`, `GET /api/forms/:id/submissions/export`
- Existing repositories: `formsRepository`, `formSubmissionsRepository`
- Existing components: `FormsListComponent` at `/app/tools/form-builder`
- Authentication middleware and tenant filtering already implemented

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**

- Angular signals and computed properties for reactive state management
- PrimeNG components (DataTable, Charts, Buttons, Dialogs) with Tailwind CSS
- Repository pattern for data access with TypeScript strict mode
- `AsyncHandler` wrapper for Express route error handling
- JSDoc comments for API documentation (Swagger auto-generation)

**Critical Compatibility Requirements:**

- Maintain existing submission retrieval and CSV export functionality
- Use existing authentication and authorization patterns (user ownership, admin tenant access)
- Follow existing validation patterns using express-validator
- Respect existing pagination and filtering conventions

**Each Story Must Include:**

- Verification that existing form builder and submission features remain intact
- Performance testing for large datasets (1000+ submissions)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) for new UI components
- Unit and integration test coverage matching existing patterns

**Epic Delivery Goal:** Deliver an **analytics dashboard for form submissions** with visualizations,
