# Story 8.4: Automated Development-Only Component Scaffolding for Tools - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **super administrator in development mode**, I want **automatic component scaffolding when
creating new tools**, So that **I can immediately develop tool functionality with proper file
structure and routing without manual setup**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Tool creation wizard from Epic 8 Story 2, tool-container component routing system
- Technology: Angular 20+ standalone components, Node.js file system operations, environment
  detection
- Follows pattern: Short-link component structure with dedicated directory, service, and component
  files
- Touch points: Tool creation API endpoint, tool-container switch statement, file system operations

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Development Mode Detection**: Component scaffolding only activates when `NODE_ENV` is set to
   'development' or local dev environment detected
2. **Directory Structure Creation**: Automatically create organized folder structure at
   `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/{tool-key}/` with subdirectories: `components/`,
   main component file, service file
3. **Component Generation**: Generate main tool component following short-link component pattern
   with proper Angular 20+ standalone structure, imports, and basic template
4. **Service Generation**: Create dedicated service file with basic CRUD operations template and
   proper injection setup
5. **Routing Integration**: Automatically update tool-container component switch statement to
   include new tool component import and case

**Integration Requirements:** 6. Existing tool creation workflow through wizard continues unchanged
in production 7. New scaffolding integrates seamlessly with current POST `/api/admin/tools` endpoint
response 8. Generated components follow existing short-link component patterns for styling,
structure, and PrimeNG usage 9. Tool-container dynamic routing maintains backward compatibility with
existing tools

**Quality Requirements:** 10. Component generation includes proper TypeScript compilation and
linting compliance 11. Generated components include basic unit test files following existing test
patterns 12. Development environment detection prevents accidental scaffolding in production 13.
Error handling for file system operations with proper user feedback

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend tool creation service to include post-creation scaffolding hook
  that triggers only in development
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow short-link component structure
  (`apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/short-link/`) for directory organization, imports,
  and component structure
- **Key Constraints**: Must only activate in development mode, generated code must pass TypeScript
  compilation, maintain existing tool-container routing patterns

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Development environment detection correctly prevents scaffolding in production
- [ ] Organized directory structure created automatically with proper naming conventions
- [ ] Generated components follow existing patterns and compile without errors
- [ ] Tool-container routing updated automatically to include new components
- [ ] Generated code includes basic unit tests and follows project standards
- [ ] Existing tool creation workflow unaffected in production environments

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Accidental component generation in production environment
- **Mitigation**: Strict development environment detection with multiple validation layers
- **Rollback**: File deletion capability and version control rollback for generated files

**Compatibility Verification:**

- ✅ No breaking changes to existing tool creation APIs
- ✅ File system changes are additive only (new directories/files)
- ✅ Tool-container component updates maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Performance impact negligible (only runs in development)
