## Epic Stories

### Story 6.1: DigitalOcean Spaces Backend Service

**Status:** Ready for Development

#### User Story

As a **system administrator**, I want **a robust backend service for DigitalOcean Spaces
integration**, So that **the application can securely store and retrieve user avatars from cloud
storage**.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing user management system, environment configuration, Express.js backend
- Technology: Express.js, TypeScript, DigitalOcean Spaces SDK (AWS S3-compatible), PostgreSQL
- Follows pattern: Existing service layer architecture and environment configuration patterns
- Touch points: User profile system, environment variables, error handling middleware

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Install and configure DigitalOcean Spaces SDK (aws-sdk v3 or @aws-sdk/client-s3)
2. Create `StorageService` class with methods: uploadFile, deleteFile, getFileUrl, validateFile
3. Implement environment configuration for DO Spaces (endpoint, region, key, secret, bucket name)

**Integration Requirements:** 4. Service integrates with existing environment configuration
pattern 5. Error handling follows existing backend error middleware structure 6. File validation
includes security checks (file type, size limits)

**Quality Requirements:** 7. Storage service covered by unit tests with mocked DO Spaces calls 8.
Configuration validation ensures all required environment variables present 9. Proper error handling
for network failures and invalid credentials

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new StorageService in services/ directory following existing
  service patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing services architecture and environment config
  structure
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle network failures gracefully; file validation must prevent
  security issues

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] DigitalOcean Spaces SDK integrated and configured
- [ ] StorageService implemented with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Environment configuration added and validated
- [ ] Unit tests cover service functionality with mocked external calls
- [ ] Error handling implemented following existing patterns
- [ ] Security validations in place for file uploads

### Story 6.2: User Avatar Upload System

**Status:** Ready for Development

#### User Story

As a **registered user**, I want **to upload and manage my profile avatar through the application**,
So that **my avatar is stored securely in cloud storage and displays consistently across the
application**.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing user profile system, authentication middleware, database schema
- Technology: Express.js endpoints, multer for file uploads, PostgreSQL user table enhancement
- Follows pattern: Existing user profile endpoints and database migration patterns
- Touch points: User model, profile endpoints, authentication verification

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Create avatar upload endpoint `POST /api/users/avatar` with file validation and authentication
2. Add `avatar_url` field to users table via database migration
3. Implement avatar retrieval in existing user profile endpoints (`GET /api/users/profile`)

**Integration Requirements:** 4. Existing user profile functionality continues unchanged 5. Avatar
upload requires valid authentication (existing JWT or API token system) 6. Database migration is
backward compatible

**Quality Requirements:** 7. File upload validation (type: jpg, png, gif; max size: 5MB) 8. Avatar
endpoints covered by integration tests 9. Existing user profile tests continue passing

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing user profile endpoints; use multer middleware for file
  handling
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current user.routes.js and user.controller.js patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must validate file types/sizes; authentication required; graceful handling of
  upload failures

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] Avatar upload endpoint implemented with proper validation
- [ ] Database migration adds avatar_url field to users table
- [ ] Avatar display integrated into existing profile endpoints
- [ ] File upload validation prevents security issues
- [ ] Integration tests cover avatar upload/retrieval functionality
- [ ] Existing user profile functionality regression tested

### Story 6.3: Frontend Avatar Management UI

**Status:** Ready for Development

#### User Story

As a **registered user**, I want **an intuitive interface to upload and change my avatar in my
profile settings**, So that **I can easily manage my profile image with immediate visual feedback**.

#### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing profile.component.ts, Angular file upload patterns, user service
- Technology: Angular 20+, reactive forms, file upload handling, existing UI components
- Follows pattern: Current profile component structure and PrimeNG component usage
- Touch points: Profile settings section, AuthService, form validation, user state management

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Add avatar upload section to existing profile.component.ts with file picker and preview
2. Implement drag-and-drop file upload with progress indicator
3. Display current avatar with option to change or remove

**Integration Requirements:** 4. Existing profile functionality (user info editing) continues to
work unchanged 5. Avatar upload follows existing form validation patterns 6. Integration with
existing AuthService and user state management

**Quality Requirements:** 7. File upload validation on frontend matches backend requirements 8.
Avatar UI components covered by Angular component tests 9. Responsive design works across desktop
and mobile devices

#### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add avatar management section to existing profile component; create
  AvatarUploadComponent
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current profile.component.ts structure and PrimeNG
  FileUpload component
- **Key Constraints:** Must follow existing UI patterns; validate files before upload; handle upload
  errors gracefully

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] Avatar upload interface added to profile component
- [ ] File picker with drag-and-drop functionality implemented
- [ ] Avatar preview and change functionality working
- [ ] Frontend validation matches backend requirements
- [ ] Component tests cover avatar upload functionality

## Epic Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing user profile APIs remain unchanged (extend only)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (add avatar URL field)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing Angular/PrimeNG patterns
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (CDN delivery)

## Epic Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** External dependency on DigitalOcean service availability
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper error handling, fallback to default avatars, retry mechanisms
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flag to disable avatar uploads, remove DO Spaces integration, revert to
  default avatars

## Epic Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing user functionality verified through testing
- [ ] DO Spaces integration working correctly with proper error handling
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup and configuration instructions
- [ ] No regression in existing user profile features

## Implementation Sequence

**Recommended Development Order:**

1. **Story 6.1 First** - Backend service provides foundation for storage operations
2. **Story 6.2 Second** - API endpoints can be built and tested with storage service ready
3. **Story 6.3 Last** - Frontend UI completes the user-facing feature

**Key Integration Points:**

- All stories build on existing user profile system
- Storage service reuses existing service architecture
- API endpoints follow current authentication patterns
- UI integrates with existing profile component structure

## Story Manager Handoff

**Development Team Handoff:**

"This brownfield epic enhances the existing user profile system with cloud-based avatar storage. Key
considerations:

- This builds on existing system running Angular 20+ frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL, with
  JWT authentication
- Integration points: existing user profile system, service layer architecture, profile UI
  components
- Existing patterns to follow: service layer structure, Express.js endpoints, Angular standalone
  components
- Critical compatibility requirements: maintain existing user profile functionality, follow current
  UI patterns, ensure backward database compatibility
- Each story includes verification that existing user profile functionality remains intact

The epic maintains system integrity while delivering scalable cloud storage for user avatars using
DigitalOcean Spaces."
