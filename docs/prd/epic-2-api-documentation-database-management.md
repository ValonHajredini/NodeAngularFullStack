# Epic 2: API Documentation & Database Management

**Epic Goal:** Create a fully documented and testable backend with interactive API documentation and database management tools that showcase the boilerplate's professional-grade development experience.

## Story 2.1: Swagger OpenAPI Documentation

As a developer,
I want interactive API documentation with testing capabilities,
so that I can understand and validate all available endpoints without external tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. OpenAPI 3.0 specification generated automatically from Express.js routes and middleware
2. Swagger UI interface accessible via browser with complete endpoint documentation
3. Interactive testing capability for all endpoints including authentication flows
4. Request/response examples and schema definitions for all data models
5. API documentation includes authentication requirements and error response codes

## Story 2.2: Database Management Interface

As a developer,
I want browser-based database management tools,
so that I can inspect and modify data during development without command-line tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. pgWeb interface integrated into Docker environment with secure access
2. Database tables, relationships, and indexes visible through web interface
3. Ability to execute SQL queries and view results within the management interface
4. Data export and import capabilities for backup and testing scenarios
5. User management interface shows seed users and allows role modifications

## Story 2.3: CRUD API Endpoints

As a developer,
I want complete CRUD operations for user management,
so that I can understand how to implement similar patterns for business entities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users with proper HTTP methods
2. Request validation and sanitization prevent SQL injection and malformed data
3. Proper HTTP status codes and error messages for all success and failure scenarios
4. Pagination support for list endpoints with configurable page sizes
5. Audit logging tracks user modifications for security and debugging purposes

## Story 2.4: API Testing and Validation

As a developer,
I want comprehensive API testing examples,
so that I can understand testing patterns and validate the boilerplate's functionality.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration tests cover all authentication and CRUD endpoints with various scenarios
2. Test data setup and teardown processes maintain clean testing environment
3. API response validation ensures proper JSON structure and data types
4. Performance testing validates response times meet NFR requirements (<2 seconds)
5. Security testing validates JWT handling and authorization boundaries
