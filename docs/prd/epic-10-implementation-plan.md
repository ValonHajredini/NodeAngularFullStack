## Risk Management

### Risk Register

| Risk                                     | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                   | Owner         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Large datasets cause performance issues  | Medium      | High   | Implement streaming, caching, lazy loading   | Backend Lead  |
| Chart library compatibility issues       | Low         | Medium | Test PrimeNG Chart early, have fallback plan | Frontend Lead |
| Export timeout for very large datasets   | Medium      | Medium | Increase timeout, add progress tracking      | Backend Lead  |
| Browser compatibility issues with charts | Low         | Medium | Test on all supported browsers early         | QA Lead       |
| Accessibility issues with visualizations | Medium      | Medium | Include accessibility tests in CI/CD         | Frontend Lead |

### Contingency Plans

**If streaming export doesn't perform well:**

- Fallback: Queue-based export with email delivery
- Use background job processor (e.g., Bull queue)
- Generate CSV asynchronously and send download link via email

**If client-side statistics calculations are too slow:**

- Move calculations to backend API endpoints
- Cache results in Redis
- Pre-calculate common statistics on form publish

**If chart rendering causes memory issues:**

- Limit visible charts to 10 at a time
- Implement infinite scroll with lazy loading
- Offer "Export All Charts as PDF" instead of rendering all

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Phases

**Phase 1: Backend Deployment (Story 10.3 backend)**

- Deploy enhanced export endpoint with feature flag disabled
- Run migration to add database indexes
- Monitor database performance
- Enable feature flag for internal testing

**Phase 2: Frontend Deployment (Stories 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 frontend)**

- Deploy analytics page with feature flag
- Deploy charts dashboard
- Deploy export dialog
- Enable feature for beta users (10% rollout)

**Phase 3: Full Rollout**

- Monitor performance metrics and error rates
- Gradually increase rollout to 25%, 50%, 100%
- Collect user feedback
- Address any issues promptly

### Feature Flags

```typescript
// Environment configuration
export const environment = {
  features: {
    formAnalytics: true, // Enable analytics page
    formCharts: true, // Enable charts dashboard
    enhancedExport: true, // Enable filtered export
    bulkDelete: false, // Admin bulk delete (future)
  },
};
```

### Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics to Track:**

- Analytics page load time (p50, p95, p99)
- Chart rendering time
- CSV export completion time by row count
- CSV export failure rate
- Memory usage during exports
- API endpoint response times

**Alerts:**

- Export endpoint timeout >30s
- Memory usage >500MB during export
- Analytics page error rate >1%
- Chart rendering failure >5%

### Rollback Plan

**Immediate Rollback (if critical issue):**

1. Disable feature flags in environment config
2. Redeploy previous version if needed
3. Remove analytics routes from Angular routing
4. No database rollback needed (indexes can remain)

**Partial Rollback:**

- Disable only charts dashboard if chart issues
- Disable only enhanced export if export issues
- Keep basic analytics page if table view works
