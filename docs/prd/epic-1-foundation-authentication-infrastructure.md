# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish a working fullstack application with Docker environment, JWT authentication system, and basic Angular frontend that developers can clone, run with a single command, and immediately test with seed users.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Docker Environment

As a developer,
I want to clone the repository and run a single Docker command to start the complete development environment,
so that I can begin development immediately without complex setup procedures.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository includes complete Docker Compose configuration with Express.js backend, Angular frontend, and PostgreSQL database
2. Single `docker-compose up` command starts all services with hot-reload capabilities
3. All services are accessible on defined ports with health checks confirming startup success
4. Development environment includes pgWeb interface accessible via browser for database inspection
5. Clear README documentation guides developers through initial setup in under 30 minutes

## Story 1.2: Express.js Backend Foundation

As a developer,
I want a complete Express.js backend with TypeScript, middleware, and database connectivity,
so that I have a professional foundation for building API endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Express.js server configured with TypeScript, CORS, and JSON parsing middleware
2. PostgreSQL connection established with connection pooling and error handling
3. Basic health check endpoint returns system status and database connectivity
4. Environment variable configuration for database connection and JWT secrets
5. Structured project organization with controllers, middleware, and utilities folders

## Story 1.3: JWT Authentication System

As a user,
I want to register, login, and manage my profile with secure authentication,
so that I can access protected features of the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration endpoint with email validation and password hashing
2. Login endpoint returns JWT token with appropriate expiration and refresh capabilities
3. Password reset functionality with secure token generation and email placeholder
4. Protected profile management endpoints for viewing and updating user information
5. JWT middleware validates tokens on protected routes and handles expired tokens gracefully

## Story 1.4: Database Schema and Seed Users

As a developer,
I want pre-populated test users with different permission levels,
so that I can immediately test authentication and authorization features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL schema includes users table with appropriate fields and constraints
2. Database migration system supports schema changes and version control
3. Seed data script creates test users with different roles (admin, user, readonly)
4. Test user credentials are clearly documented and visible on login interface
5. Seed data includes realistic user profiles for comprehensive testing scenarios

## Story 1.5: Angular Frontend Foundation

As a user,
I want a modern Angular frontend with authentication components and routing,
so that I can interact with the backend through a professional interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Angular 20+ project with TypeScript, routing, and authentication guards configured
2. Login and registration components with form validation and error handling
3. Navigation system adapts based on authentication status and user permissions
4. API service layer handles HTTP requests with authentication headers and error management
5. Responsive design using Tailwind CSS demonstrates professional styling standards
