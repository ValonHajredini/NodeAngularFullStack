# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish a working fullstack application with Docker environment, JWT authentication system, and basic Angular frontend that developers can clone, run with a single command, and immediately test with seed users.

## Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Structure

As a developer,
I want to create both Express.js and Angular projects from scratch with proper folder structure,
so that I have a clean, organized fullstack application foundation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize Express.js backend project using `npm init` with TypeScript configuration
2. Initialize Angular frontend project using `ng new` with Angular 20+ and standalone components
3. Create unified project structure with `/backend` and `/frontend` folders at root level
4. Configure package.json scripts for both projects with development and production builds
5. Set up shared TypeScript configurations and ESLint rules across both projects
6. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore for Node.js and Angular artifacts

## Story 1.2: Docker Environment Setup

As a developer,
I want to containerize the entire application stack with Docker Compose,
so that I can run the complete development environment with a single command.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create Dockerfile for Express.js backend with multi-stage build for optimization
2. Create Dockerfile for Angular frontend with nginx for production serving
3. Docker Compose configuration orchestrates backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL services
4. Single `docker-compose up` command starts all services with hot-reload capabilities
5. All services are accessible on defined ports (backend: 3000, frontend: 4200, database: 5432)
6. Development environment includes pgWeb interface accessible via browser for database inspection

## Story 1.3: Express.js Backend Foundation

As a developer,
I want a complete Express.js backend with TypeScript, middleware, and database connectivity,
so that I have a professional foundation for building API endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Install Express.js with TypeScript support and necessary type definitions
2. Configure TypeScript compiler options for Node.js backend development
3. Set up Express.js server with CORS, body-parser, and helmet middleware
4. PostgreSQL connection established with TypeORM or Prisma for database management
5. Basic health check endpoint returns system status and database connectivity
6. Environment variable configuration using dotenv for database connection and JWT secrets
7. Structured project organization with controllers, routes, models, middleware, and utilities folders

## Story 1.4: JWT Authentication System

As a user,
I want to register, login, and manage my profile with secure authentication,
so that I can access protected features of the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration endpoint with email validation and bcrypt password hashing
2. Login endpoint returns JWT access token and refresh token with appropriate expiration
3. Token refresh endpoint for obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication
4. Password reset functionality with secure token generation and email placeholder
5. Protected profile management endpoints for viewing and updating user information
6. JWT middleware validates tokens on protected routes and handles expired tokens gracefully
7. Logout endpoint with token blacklisting or invalidation mechanism

## Story 1.5: Database Schema and Seed Users

As a developer,
I want pre-populated test users with different permission levels,
so that I can immediately test authentication and authorization features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL schema includes users table with appropriate fields and constraints
2. Database migration system (TypeORM migrations or Prisma migrate) for schema version control
3. Seed data script creates test users with different roles (admin, user, readonly)
4. Test user credentials are clearly documented and visible on login interface
5. Seed data includes realistic user profiles for comprehensive testing scenarios
6. Database indexes on frequently queried fields for performance optimization

## Story 1.6: Angular Frontend Foundation

As a user,
I want a modern Angular frontend with authentication components and routing,
so that I can interact with the backend through a professional interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create Angular 20+ project using Angular CLI: `ng new frontend --standalone --routing --style=scss`
2. Configure Angular project with standalone components and signals for modern architecture
3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
4. Set up Angular environments for development, staging, and production API endpoints
5. Create core module structure: auth, shared, features folders with proper module organization
6. Implement HTTP interceptor for automatic JWT token attachment to API requests
7. Configure proxy.conf.json for local development API routing to Express backend

## Story 1.7: Authentication UI Components

As a user,
I want professional login, registration, and profile management interfaces,
so that I can securely access and manage my account.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Login component with reactive forms, validation, and error display
2. Registration component with password strength indicator and confirmation
3. Password reset request and confirmation components with token handling
4. User profile component displaying and editing user information
5. Navigation component that adapts based on authentication status
6. Auth guard protecting routes that require authentication
7. Loading states and error handling for all authentication operations
8. Responsive design working seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices
