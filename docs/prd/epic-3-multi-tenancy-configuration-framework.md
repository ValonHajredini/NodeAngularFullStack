# Epic 3: Multi-Tenancy & Configuration Framework

**Epic Goal:** Implement configurable multi-tenancy system with environment toggles and administrative interfaces that demonstrate the boilerplate's universal adaptability to different business models.

## Story 3.1: Multi-Tenancy Database Design

As a system architect,
I want a database schema that supports both single-tenant and multi-tenant operations,
so that the same codebase can serve different business models without modification.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Database schema includes tenant table with configuration and isolation settings
2. User table includes optional tenant_id foreign key for multi-tenant mode
3. Database queries automatically filter by tenant context when multi-tenancy is enabled
4. Single-tenant mode operates without tenant filtering or additional overhead
5. Migration scripts handle conversion between single-tenant and multi-tenant modes

## Story 3.2: Environment Configuration System

As a developer,
I want environment variable controls for multi-tenancy features,
so that I can deploy the same codebase in different operational modes.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Environment variables control multi-tenancy enable/disable with clear documentation
2. Configuration validation ensures consistent settings across all application components
3. Default configuration supports single-tenant mode for simplest deployment scenario
4. Multi-tenant configuration includes tenant isolation and data security settings
5. Configuration changes require application restart with clear warning messages

## Story 3.3: Tenant Management Interface

As an administrator,
I want to manage tenant configurations and settings,
so that I can control multi-tenant operations through a web interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin interface for creating, configuring, and managing tenant accounts
2. Tenant-specific settings include branding, feature toggles, and user limits
3. Tenant isolation validation ensures data separation between tenant accounts
4. Admin dashboard shows tenant usage statistics and system health metrics
5. Tenant onboarding process includes setup wizard and validation steps

## Story 3.4: JWT Multi-Tenant Token Handling

As a user in a multi-tenant system,
I want my authentication to work correctly within my tenant context,
so that I can access appropriate data and features for my organization.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. JWT tokens include tenant context when multi-tenancy is enabled
2. API endpoints automatically filter data based on token tenant information
3. Cross-tenant access prevention with clear error messages and logging
4. Token validation includes tenant status and permissions checking
5. Single-tenant mode operates without tenant token overhead or complexity
