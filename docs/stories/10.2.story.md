# Story 10.2: Form Repository and Service Layer

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** backend developer, **I want** to implement repository pattern for form data access and
service layer for business logic, **so that** database operations are abstracted and form
creation/management logic is centralized.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: `FormsRepository` class in `/apps/api/src/repositories/forms.repository.ts` implements
   methods: `create()`, `findById()`, `findByUserId()`, `update()`, `delete()`
2. **AC2**: `FormSchemasRepository` class implements methods: `createSchema()`, `findByFormId()`,
   `findByToken()`, `updateSchema()`, `publishSchema()`, `unpublishSchema()`
3. **AC3**: `FormSubmissionsRepository` class implements methods: `create()`,
   `findByFormSchemaId()`, `findByFormId()`, `countByFormSchemaId()`
4. **AC4**: All repositories use existing connection pool from `src/database/pool.ts`
5. **AC5**: `FormsService` class in `/apps/api/src/services/forms.service.ts` implements business
   logic: `createForm()`, `publishForm()`, `validateFormSchema()`, `generateRenderToken()`
6. **AC6**: Token generation uses `jsonwebtoken` library with `FORM_RENDER_TOKEN_SECRET` from
   environment
7. **AC7**: Form schema validation prevents duplicate field names and validates regex patterns
8. **AC8**: Service layer includes JSDoc comments for all public methods

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 10.1 created the database schema and shared types. This story builds the data access and
business logic layer on top of that foundation.

### Data Models

**Repository Pattern:** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Data-Access-Layer]

- All repositories extend BaseRepository<T> for common CRUD operations
- Use existing connection pool from `src/database/pool.ts`
- Tenant filtering applied when `tenantId` parameter provided
- Parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention

**Service Layer Pattern:** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Service-Architecture]

- Services contain business logic and orchestrate repository calls
- Services inject repository dependencies via constructor
- Services validate data before passing to repositories
- Services handle complex operations like token generation and schema validation

### API Specifications

No API routes in this story. Service and repository layers only. APIs will be added in Story 10.3.

### Component Specifications

No frontend components in this story. Backend data layer only.

### File Locations

**Repositories:** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#apps/api]

- Create: `/apps/api/src/repositories/forms.repository.ts`
- Create: `/apps/api/src/repositories/form-schemas.repository.ts`
- Create: `/apps/api/src/repositories/form-submissions.repository.ts`
- Pattern: Extend BaseRepository (see `/apps/api/src/repositories/base.repository.ts`)

**Services:** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#apps/api]

- Create: `/apps/api/src/services/forms.service.ts`
- Pattern: Follow existing services (see `/apps/api/src/services/auth.service.ts`,
  `/apps/api/src/services/users.service.ts`)

**Tests:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend-Tests]

- Create: `/apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/forms.repository.test.ts`
- Create: `/apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/form-schemas.repository.test.ts`
- Create: `/apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/form-submissions.repository.test.ts`
- Create: `/apps/api/tests/unit/services/forms.service.test.ts`

### Testing Requirements

**Repository Tests:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend-API-Test]

- Use Jest with supertest for integration tests
- Mock database connection pool for unit tests
- Test tenant isolation when multi-tenancy enabled
- Verify foreign key constraints and cascade deletes
- Test connection pooling stability (no leaks)

**Service Tests:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend-API-Test]

- Mock repository dependencies with Jest spies
- Test schema validation logic thoroughly
- Test JWT token generation and verification
- Test error handling for invalid inputs
- Verify business logic rules (e.g., owner-only deletion)

**Test Commands:** [Source: docs/CLAUDE.md#Testing-Commands]

- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run backend tests only: `npm run test:api`
- Run specific test file:
  `npm --workspace=apps/api run test -- --testPathPattern="forms.service.test.ts"`

### Technical Constraints

**Repository Standards:** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Data-Access-Layer]

- Extend BaseRepository<T> class for common functionality
- Use existing pool from `src/database/pool.ts`
- Apply tenant filtering when `tenantId` provided
- Use parameterized queries ($1, $2, etc.) to prevent SQL injection
- Return null for not found (don't throw errors in repository layer)

**Service Standards:** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Service-Architecture]

- Constructor dependency injection for repositories
- Business logic validation before database operations
- Use existing error classes from `src/utils/errors.ts` (ApiError)
- JSDoc comments required for all public methods
- Throw ApiError with appropriate status codes (400, 404, 500)

**JWT Token Generation:** [Source:
docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Authentication-and-Authorization]

- Use `jsonwebtoken` library (already in dependencies)
- Token payload: formSchemaId, expiresAt, issuer, issued timestamp
- Use dedicated secret: `FORM_RENDER_TOKEN_SECRET` from environment
- Token format: Standard JWT (header.payload.signature)
- Expiration enforcement on verification (not just client-side)

**Multi-Tenancy:** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Data-Access-Layer]

- Repository methods accept optional `tenantId` parameter
- Queries include tenant filtering when `tenantId` provided
- Service layer receives `tenantId` from authenticated request
- Forms isolated per tenant (users can only access their tenant's forms)

**Error Handling:** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical-Fullstack-Rules]

- Use ApiError class from `src/utils/errors.ts`
- Throw errors with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include descriptive error messages for validation failures
- Services throw errors, repositories return null for not found

### Testing

**Test File Location:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend-Tests]

- Unit tests: `/apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/` and `/apps/api/tests/unit/services/`
- Integration tests will be added in Story 10.3 when routes are implemented

**Testing Standards:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Backend-API-Test]

- Use Jest as testing framework
- Mock external dependencies (database, other services)
- Test happy paths and error cases
- Verify error handling and validation logic
- Check multi-tenancy isolation

**Testing Frameworks:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Jest 29+ for unit testing
- Supertest 6+ for API integration testing (Story 10.3)
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type checking

- **All ACs Met:** ✓ PASS - See Requirements Traceability below

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1 - FormsRepository Methods:** ✓ COVERED

- Given a user wants to create a form
- When FormsRepository.create() is called with form metadata
- Then form is created with tenant context and proper field mapping
- **Test Coverage:** forms.repository.test.ts lines 61-131 (4 tests: with/without tenant, error
  handling, empty result)

**AC2 - FormSchemasRepository Methods:** ✓ COVERED

- Given a form schema needs versioning and publishing
- When schema operations are performed (create, find, update, publish, unpublish)
- Then schemas are managed with proper token handling and version ordering
- **Test Coverage:** form-schemas.repository.test.ts lines 1-387 (19 tests covering all methods)

**AC3 - FormSubmissionsRepository Methods:** ✓ COVERED

- Given form submissions need to be stored and retrieved
- When submission operations are performed
- Then submissions are created, counted, and retrieved by schema/form ID
- **Test Coverage:** form-submissions.repository.test.ts lines 1-204 (14 tests covering all methods)

**AC4 - Database Pool Usage:** ✓ COVERED

- Given repositories need database access
- When any repository method is called
- Then connection pool from databaseService.getPool() is used
- **Test Coverage:** All repository tests mock databaseService.getPool() - verified in lines 7-11 of
  each test file

**AC5 - FormsService Business Logic:** ✓ COVERED

- Given complex form operations need orchestration
- When FormsService methods are called (createForm, publishForm, validateFormSchema,
  generateRenderToken)
- Then business logic validates, coordinates repositories, and handles errors
- **Test Coverage:** forms.service.test.ts lines 85-325 (19 tests covering all service methods)

**AC6 - JWT Token Generation:** ✓ COVERED

- Given forms need render tokens for public access
- When generateRenderToken() is called
- Then JWT is created using jsonwebtoken library with FORM_RENDER_TOKEN_SECRET
- **Test Coverage:** forms.service.test.ts lines 289-325 + environment config in .env.example and
  .env.development

**AC7 - Schema Validation Logic:** ✓ COVERED

- Given form schemas must be valid
- When validateFormSchema() is called
- Then duplicate field names are detected and regex patterns are validated
- **Test Coverage:** forms.service.test.ts lines 211-280 (8 tests: valid schema, duplicates, invalid
  regex, missing fields, missing settings)

**AC8 - JSDoc Documentation:** ✓ COVERED

- Given developers need to understand the codebase
- When viewing any public method
- Then comprehensive JSDoc with @param, @returns, @throws, @example is present
- **Manual Verification:** Reviewed all implementation files - every public method has complete
  JSDoc

**Coverage Summary:** 8/8 ACs fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

### Security Review

**Status:** ✓ PASS - No security concerns

**Findings:**

- Parameterized SQL queries ($1, $2, etc.) properly prevent SQL injection
- JWT token generation uses environment variable secret (not hardcoded)
- Owner verification in deleteByOwner() prevents unauthorized deletions
- Tenant filtering prevents cross-tenant data access
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Input validation in service layer before database operations

**Note:** API routes with authentication/authorization will be added in Story 10.3, which will
require additional security review at that time.

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** ✓ PASS - No performance concerns identified

**Findings:**

- Database connection pool properly used with client.release() in finally blocks
- Dynamic query building avoids unnecessary fields in INSERT/UPDATE
- Queries include proper ORDER BY for predictable results
- JSON.stringify() used for JSONB fields (appropriate for PostgreSQL)
- No N+1 query patterns detected
- Repository methods return null instead of throwing for not-found cases (appropriate pattern)

**Future Optimization Opportunities (Not blocking):**

- Consider adding database indexes on frequently queried fields (form_id, user_id, tenant_id) in
  Story 10.3 migration
- Monitor query performance once integration tests with real database are added

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Status:** ✓ EXCELLENT

**Unit Test Quality:**

- Proper mocking of database dependencies using Jest

- Error scenarios: Database errors, missing data, validation failures

**Test Design Quality:**

- Tests are focused and test one thing at a time
- Good use of beforeEach/afterEach for test isolation
- Mock data is defined at top of test files for reusability
- Test descriptions clearly state what is being tested

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
