## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]

- Frontend tests: alongside source files with .spec.ts extension
- Use Karma/Jasmine for Angular component testing
- Mock service dependencies with jasmine.createSpyObj
- Test user interactions: clicks, keyboard events, drag operations
- Use fixture.detectChanges() after state changes

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]

All sub-components should follow this pattern:

- Standalone components with explicit imports
- Input/Output for parent-child communication
- OnPush change detection strategy
- Proper TypeScript typing for all props

**Sub-component Directory Structure:**

```
svg-drawing/
├── svg-drawing.component.ts
├── svg-drawing.service.ts
└── components/
    ├── canvas-renderer/
    ├── drawing-toolbar/
    ├── shape-properties/
    └── guide-overlay/  (for Story 3)
```

### State Management

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Management Architecture]

**Extended DrawingState:**

```typescript
interface DrawingState {
  shapes: Shape[];
  selectedShapeId: string | null;
  currentTool: 'line' | 'polygon' | 'select' | 'delete';
  isDrawing: boolean;
  activeVertices: Point[]; // For in-progress polygon
  snapEnabled: boolean;
  snapThreshold: number;
  commandHistory: Command[];
  redoStack: Command[];
}
```

### Command Pattern Implementation

Undo/redo requires command pattern for operation history:

```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
  redo(): void;
}

class AddShapeCommand implements Command {
  constructor(
    private service: SvgDrawingService,
    private shape: Shape
  ) {}

  execute(): void {
    this.service.addShapeToState(this.shape);
  }

  undo(): void {
    this.service.removeShapeFromState(this.shape.id);
  }

  redo(): void {
    this.execute();
  }
}
```

### Polygon Drawing Logic

**Vertex Placement:**

- Click adds vertex to activeVertices array
- Show line preview from last vertex to cursor
- Display vertex markers (small circles) at each point
- Highlight first vertex for closure indication

**Polygon Closure:**

- Double-click closes polygon
- Click near first vertex (within 10px) closes polygon
- ESC key cancels drawing
- Minimum 3 vertices required

### Shape Selection Algorithms

**Point-in-Polygon (Ray Casting):**

```typescript
function isPointInPolygon(point: Point, vertices: Point[]): boolean {
  let inside = false;
  for (let i = 0, j = vertices.length - 1; i < vertices.length; j = i++) {
    const xi = vertices[i].x,
      yi = vertices[i].y;
    const xj = vertices[j].x,
      yj = vertices[j].y;

    const intersect =
      yi > point.y !== yj > point.y && point.x < ((xj - xi) * (point.y - yi)) / (yj - yi) + xi;
    if (intersect) inside = !inside;
  }
  return inside;
}
```

**Point-on-Line:**

```typescript
function isPointOnLine(point: Point, line: LineShape, tolerance: number = 5): boolean {
  const distance = distanceFromPointToLine(point, line.start, line.end);
  return distance <= tolerance;
}
```

### PrimeNG Components

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

**Toolbar:**

- ToolbarModule for main toolbar container
- ButtonModule for tool buttons
- ButtonGroupModule for grouped tool selection
- TooltipModule for keyboard shortcut hints

**Shape Properties:**

- ColorPickerModule for color selection
- SliderModule for stroke width
- InputNumberModule for numeric values
- PanelModule for collapsible sections

### Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]

Use Angular's HostListener for keyboard events:

```typescript
@HostListener('document:keydown', ['$event'])
handleKeyboardEvent(event: KeyboardEvent): void {
  if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === 'z') {
    event.preventDefault();
    this.undo();
  }
  // Additional shortcuts...
}
```

  `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/svg-drawing/components/drawing-toolbar/`
- Shape properties:
  `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/svg-drawing/components/shape-properties/`
- Service updates: `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/services/svg-drawing.service.ts`
- Shared types: `packages/shared/src/types/tools.interface.ts`

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 9.1:

- Canvas renderer component handles all shape rendering
- Drawing state managed with Angular signals
- Line drawing implemented with snap guides
- Angle calculation utilities available
- SVG rendering approach chosen for shape management

**Key Learnings:**

- Use computed signals for derived state (e.g., canUndo, canRedo)
- Throttle mouse events for performance
- Immutable state updates required for change detection

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]

- JSDoc comments for all public methods and complex logic
- Use proper TypeScript types - no 'any'
- Event emitters should have descriptive names
- Component inputs should be readonly
- Use OnDestroy for cleanup (keyboard listeners)

### Responsive Design

**Toolbar:**

- Fixed position at top
- Full width on all screen sizes
- Compact button layout for mobile

**Shape Properties Panel:**

- Fixed right side panel on desktop (300px width)
- Hidden on screens < 1024px
- Collapsible with toggle button
- Overlay mode on mobile

### Performance Considerations

[Source: Epic 9 Risk Mitigation]

- Use trackBy functions for ngFor shape rendering
- Debounce property change events (300ms)
- Limit command history (max 50 commands)
- Clear redo stack on new action
- Use requestAnimationFrame for drag updates

### Tailwind CSS Layout

```html
<!-- Main Layout -->
<div class="relative w-full h-full">
  <!-- Toolbar -->
  <div class="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-20 bg-white shadow-md">
    <app-drawing-toolbar />
  </div>

  <!-- Canvas -->
  <div class="absolute inset-0 pt-16">
    <app-canvas-renderer />
  </div>

  <!-- Properties Panel -->
  <div class="fixed top-16 right-0 bottom-0 w-80 bg-gray-50 shadow-lg">
    <app-shape-properties />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Integration with Existing Tools

[Source: Epic 7 context]

- Maintain consistency with other tool UIs (map, calendar, todo-app)
- Use same PrimeNG theme and Tailwind styling
- Follow same component structure patterns
- Integrate with tools navigation and routing
