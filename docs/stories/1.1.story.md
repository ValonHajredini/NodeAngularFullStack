# Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Structure

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create both Express.js and Angular projects from scratch with proper folder structure,
**so that** I have a clean, organized fullstack application foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize Express.js backend project using `npm init` with TypeScript configuration
2. Initialize Angular frontend project using `ng new` with Angular 20+ and standalone components
3. Create unified project structure with `/backend` and `/frontend` folders at root level
4. Configure package.json scripts for both projects with development and production builds
5. Set up shared TypeScript configurations and ESLint rules across both projects
6. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore for Node.js and Angular artifacts

  - [ ] Configure Angular project structure according to architecture
  - [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS as per tech stack
  - [ ] Install PrimeNG v17+ for UI components
  - [ ] Configure package.json scripts to align with workspace
- [ ] Task 4: Set up shared packages and configurations (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create packages/shared with TypeScript interfaces and utilities
  - [ ] Create packages/config with shared ESLint configuration
  - [ ] Create root tsconfig.json extending to both projects
  - [ ] Configure ESLint with shared rules for both frontend and backend
  - [ ] Set up Jest configuration files for testing
- [ ] Task 5: Initialize Git repository (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Run `git init` at root level
  - [ ] Create comprehensive .gitignore file including:
    - Node modules for all packages
    - Angular build artifacts (.angular/, dist/)
    - TypeScript build files
    - Environment files (.env)
    - IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)
    - OS files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
  - [ ] Create initial commit with project structure
- [ ] Task 6: Create initial documentation and configuration files
  - [ ] Create .env.example with required environment variables
  - [ ] Create README.md with getting started instructions
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml placeholder for future Docker setup

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend tests location: `apps/web/src/app/` with `.spec.ts` files alongside components
- Backend tests location: `apps/api/tests/` with unit/ and integration/ subfolders
- Testing frameworks:
  - Frontend: Jest + Testing Library (version 29+/14+)
  - Backend: Jest + Supertest (version 29+/6+)
  - E2E: Playwright (version 1.40+)
- Test configuration files: `jest.config.js` in each app folder

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Root structure must follow:
```
nodeangularfullstack/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/ (Angular frontend)
│   └── api/ (Express.js backend)
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/ (shared types/utils)
│   └── config/ (shared configuration)
├── infrastructure/
│   └── docker/
├── scripts/
├── docs/
└── package.json (root)
```

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend: TypeScript 5.3+, Angular 20+, PrimeNG 17+, Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Backend: TypeScript 5.3+, Express.js 4.19+, PostgreSQL 15+
- Authentication: JWT + Passport.js (latest versions)
- State Management: NgRx Signals 17+ for frontend
- Build Tools: Angular CLI 17+ for frontend, esbuild via Angular

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All public functions, interfaces, and classes MUST have JSDoc comments
- Type sharing: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Never access process.env directly, use config objects
- Frontend components use PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile.tsx)
- API routes use kebab-case (e.g., /api/user-profile)
- Database tables use snake_case (e.g., user_profiles)

### File Naming Conventions
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Angular Components: `component-name.component.ts`
- Angular Services: `service-name.service.ts`
- Express Controllers: `controller-name.controller.ts`
- Express Routes: `route-name.routes.ts`
- Shared Types: `type-name.interface.ts` or `type-name.type.ts`

### Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#environment-configuration]
Required environment variables to document in .env.example:
- Database connection settings
- JWT secrets
- API endpoints
- Third-party service keys (SendGrid, DO Spaces)
