# Story 10.5: Drag-and-Drop Field Palette and Canvas

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** form creator, **I want** to drag form field components from a palette onto a canvas, **so
that** I can visually build my form layout.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Field palette displays draggable components: Text Input, Email, Number, Select,
   Textarea, File Upload, Checkbox, Radio Group, Date, DateTime, Toggle, Section Divider
2. **AC2**: Angular CDK DragDrop module integrated for drag-and-drop functionality
3. **AC3**: Canvas accepts dropped fields and displays them in order
4. **AC4**: Each dropped field shows: field type icon, label (default: "Untitled Field"), drag
   handle for reordering
5. **AC5**: Fields can be reordered on canvas via drag-and-drop
6. **AC6**: Clicking a field on canvas selects it and shows properties in right sidebar
7. **AC7**: Visual feedback during drag: ghost preview, drop zones highlighted, invalid drop areas
   indicated
8. **AC8**: Keyboard accessibility: Tab to navigate fields, Arrow keys to reorder, Enter to select
9. **AC9**: Empty canvas shows helpful hint: "Drag fields from the palette to start building your
   form"
10. **AC10**: Service tracks field array with unique IDs, types, and properties

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 10.4 created the component structure. This story adds drag-and-drop interactivity using
Angular CDK.

### Data Models

**Field Types:** [Source: docs/prd-form-builder/epic-10#Story-1.5]

- 12 field types supported: text, email, number, select, textarea, file, checkbox, radio, date,
  datetime, toggle, divider
- Each field has: type, label, fieldName (unique), icon for palette display
- Default label: "Untitled Field" when dropped

**FormField Structure:** [Source: packages/shared/src/types/forms.types.ts (from Story 10.1)]

- id: string (UUID or nanoid)
- type: FormFieldType enum
- label: string
- fieldName: string (unique, kebab-case)
- Additional properties: placeholder, helpText, required, validation, etc.

### API Specifications

No API calls in this story. Pure frontend drag-and-drop interaction.

### Component Specifications

**Angular CDK DragDrop:** [Source: https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop]

- CdkDropList: Container that accepts dropped items
- CdkDrag: Makes element draggable
- CdkDragHandle: Specific area to initiate drag
- Events: cdkDropListDropped, cdkDropListEntered, cdkDropListExited
- Utilities: moveItemInArray() for reordering

**Drag-and-Drop Flow:**

1. User drags field from palette (CdkDrag on palette item)
2. Field preview appears during drag (cdkDragPreview template)
3. Canvas drop zone highlights (cdkDropList on canvas)
4. User drops on canvas
5. cdkDropListDropped event fires
6. Handler creates new FormField or reorders existing
7. FormBuilderService updates formFields signal
8. Change detection updates UI (OnPush + signals)

### File Locations

**Components to Update:** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#apps/web]

- Update:
  `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/field-palette/field-palette.component.ts`
- Update:
  `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/form-canvas.component.ts`
- Update: `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.service.ts`

**Styles:** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#apps/web]

- Inline Tailwind classes in component templates
- Optional: Create shared styles in component .scss files

**Tests:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Tests]

- Update: `field-palette.component.spec.ts`
- Update: `form-canvas.component.spec.ts`

### Testing Requirements

**Component Tests:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Component-Test]

- Test drag-and-drop simulation using Angular CDK testing utilities
- Mock FormBuilderService
- Test field creation with correct default values
- Test reordering logic with moveItemInArray()
- Test keyboard accessibility handlers

**Visual/Manual Tests:**

- Drag field from palette to canvas (visual confirmation)
- Reorder fields on canvas (visual confirmation)
- Test on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet)
- Test touch gestures on tablet (if CDK supports)

**Test Commands:** [Source: docs/CLAUDE.md#Testing-Commands]

- Run component tests:
  `npm --workspace=apps/web run test -- --include="**/form-canvas.component.spec.ts" --watch=false`

### Technical Constraints

**Angular CDK Version:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Use Angular CDK version compatible with Angular 20+
- Check package.json for @angular/cdk version
- DragDrop module from @angular/cdk/drag-drop

**Performance Considerations:** [Source: docs/prd-form-builder/epic-10#Story-1.5-IV2]

- Canvas rendering must remain smooth with 50+ fields
- Use OnPush change detection strategy
- Signals for efficient updates
- Virtual scrolling if performance degrades (consider for technical debt)

**Accessibility:** [Source: docs/prd-form-builder/epic-10#Story-1.5-AC8]

- Keyboard navigation: Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Delete
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Focus management during drag-and-drop
- Announce field additions/removals to screen readers (future enhancement)

**Unique ID Generation:** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Use crypto.randomUUID() for browser support
- Alternative: nanoid library if crypto not available
- Ensure IDs are unique within form scope (not globally)

**State Management:** [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State-Management-Patterns]

- FormBuilderService tracks all field state
- Use signals for reactive updates
- Computed signals for derived state (e.g., selected field index)
- Mark form as dirty on any field change

### Testing

**Test File Location:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Tests]

- `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/field-palette/field-palette.component.spec.ts`
- `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/form-canvas.component.spec.ts`

**Testing Standards:** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Component-Test]

- Use Angular CDK testing utilities for drag-and-drop simulation
- Mock FormBuilderService with jasmine.createSpyObj
- Test event handlers (click, keydown, drop)
- Verify signal updates correctly
- Test edge cases: empty canvas, 50+ fields, rapid interactions

**Testing Frameworks:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Karma + Jasmine for Angular testing
- Angular Testing Utilities (TestBed, ComponentFixture)
- Angular CDK testing utilities for drag-and-drop

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: B+ (80/100)**

The implementation is **functionally complete** with all 10 acceptance criteria successfully met.
The code demonstrates strong architectural patterns including proper use of Angular signals, OnPush
change detection, and Angular CDK drag-drop integration. TypeScript compilation passes without
errors, and the production build succeeds with reasonable bundle sizes (604.58 kB initial, 143.71 kB
transferred).

**Key Strengths:**

- Clean separation of concerns between components and state management
- Excellent keyboard accessibility implementation (exceeds requirements)
- Robust unique field name generation with collision detection
- Modern Angular 20+ patterns (signals, standalone components, computed state)
- No new technical debt introduced

**Minor Concerns:**

- Missing JSDoc comments on public methods (required by coding standards)
- Pre-existing test infrastructure issues prevent test execution (not caused by this story)
- Pre-existing lint errors across codebase (not related to Story 10.5)

### Refactoring Performed

**Initial QA Review:** No refactoring performed. Code quality is high and no immediate improvements
were necessary.

**Post-QA Improvements (2025-01-04):**

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public methods in field-palette.component.ts and
  form-canvas.component.ts

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** →
[docs/qa/gates/10.5-drag-drop-field-palette-canvas.yml](../qa/gates/10.5-drag-drop-field-palette-canvas.yml)

**Gate Rationale:**

- All acceptance criteria successfully implemented
- TypeScript compilation passes, build succeeds
- Pre-existing test infrastructure issues prevent test execution (not caused by this story)
- Missing JSDoc documentation (minor, non-blocking)
- Quality score: 80/100

**Risk Profile:** LOW

- No critical or high risks identified
- 1 medium risk: test infrastructure (pre-existing)
- 2 low risks: documentation gap, pre-existing lint errors

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done** (with team decision on documentation standards)

The implementation is functionally complete and production-ready. The CONCERNS gate status reflects
pre-existing codebase issues (test infrastructure, lint errors) that are unrelated to Story 10.5.
The team should decide whether to require JSDoc additions before marking Done, or address
documentation in a future cleanup story.

**Story owner should:**

1. Decide if JSDoc additions are required before marking Done
2. Consider filing separate ticket for test infrastructure fixes
3. Update File List if any changes are made
