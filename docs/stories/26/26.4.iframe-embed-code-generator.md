# Story 26.4: Iframe Embed Code Generator - Brownfield Enhancement

**Story Status:** Approved  
**Story Owner:** Product Manager  
**Developer:** TBD  
**QA Engineer:** TBD  
**Epic:** 26 - Enhanced Form Publishing System

## User Story

As a **form creator**,  
I want **to generate iframe embed codes for my published forms with customizable dimensions**,  
So that **I can easily embed forms into external websites, blogs, and applications with proper
sizing and styling control**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: `PublishDialogComponent` and existing form rendering infrastructure
- Technology: Angular 20+ frontend with HTML iframe generation, existing public form rendering at
  `/forms/render/{shortCode}`
- Follows pattern: Copy-to-clipboard functionality from short-links tool and code generation
  utilities
- Touch points: Public form renderer, publishing modal, form URL generation

**Current System Capabilities:**

- Public forms accessible via `/forms/render/{shortCode}` route
- Form rendering optimized for external embedding contexts
- Existing copy-to-clipboard functionality in short-links components
- Responsive form design suitable for iframe embedding

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Iframe Code Generation**
   - Generate HTML iframe code with form's public URL
   - Include customizable width and height parameters
   - Add proper iframe attributes for security and functionality
   - Code formatted for easy copy-paste into external websites

2. **Customizable Iframe Properties**
   - Width and height inputs with preset options (Small: 400x600, Medium: 600x800, Large: 800x1000,
     Custom)
   - Responsive option that uses percentage-based width
   - Border and styling options (frameborder, scrolling behavior)
   - Security attributes (sandbox permissions, allowfullscreen)

3. **Iframe Code Display and Copy**
   - Textarea showing generated iframe code
   - Copy-to-clipboard button with visual feedback
   - Live preview of iframe dimensions
   - Code syntax highlighting for better readability

### Integration Requirements:

4. **Publishing Modal Enhancement**
   - New "Embed Code" section in publish modal after successful publishing
   - Accordion or tab-based UI to organize QR code and embed code sections
   - Maintains existing modal layout and performance
   - Follows current PrimeNG component styling patterns

5. **Public Form Compatibility**
   - Existing public form renderer supports iframe embedding without modifications
   - Form styling adapts properly to iframe constraints
   - Responsive design works within iframe containers
   - No breaking changes to public form rendering

6. **Security and Best Practices**
   - Generated iframe includes appropriate security attributes
   - CSP (Content Security Policy) headers configured for iframe embedding
   - X-Frame-Options headers properly configured
   - Prevents clickjacking and security vulnerabilities

### Quality Requirements:

7. **User Experience Optimization**
   - Real-time iframe code updates as user changes dimensions
   - Clear visual feedback for copy operations
   - Helpful tooltips and guidance for embed options
   - Responsive design for modal on mobile devices

8. **Code Quality and Standards**
   - Generated iframe code follows HTML5 best practices
   - Proper escaping and validation of user inputs
   - Clean, readable code output for developers
   - Accessibility considerations for embedded forms

9. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Iframe code works across modern browsers
   - Fallback handling for browsers with iframe restrictions
   - Testing across different embedding contexts
   - Mobile browser compatibility verification

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Approach:

- Create `IframeEmbedGeneratorComponent` as standalone component
- Integrate with `PublishDialogComponent` in new embed section
- Implement real-time code generation with reactive forms
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality with user feedback

### Iframe Code Template:

```html
<iframe
  src="{{BASE_URL}}/forms/render/{{shortCode}}"
  width="{{width}}"
  height="{{height}}"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="auto"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
  title="{{formTitle}}"
  loading="lazy"
>
  <p>
    Your browser does not support iframes.
    <a href="{{formUrl}}" target="_blank">Open form in new window</a>
  </p>
</iframe>
```

### Component Interface:

```typescript
interface IframeEmbedOptions {
  width: string;
  height: string;
  responsive: boolean;
  showBorder: boolean;
  allowScrolling: boolean;
  title: string;
}

interface IframeEmbedCode {
  htmlCode: string;
  previewUrl: string;
  options: IframeEmbedOptions;
}
```

### Security Headers Configuration:

```typescript
// Backend headers for iframe embedding
res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'ALLOWALL');
res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "frame-ancestors 'self' *");
```

### Key Constraints:

- Iframe code must work in external websites without dependencies
- Security attributes must balance functionality with safety
- Generated code should be minimal and clean
- Performance impact on publishing modal must be negligible

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Iframe code generator** component created and functional
- [ ] **Customizable dimensions** with preset and custom options
- [ ] **Copy-to-clipboard** functionality with visual feedback
- [ ] **Security attributes** properly configured in generated code
- [ ] **Publishing modal** enhanced with embed code section
- [ ] **Live preview** shows iframe dimensions accurately
- [ ] **Cross-browser testing** confirms iframe compatibility
- [ ] **Security headers** configured for iframe embedding
- [ ] **Documentation** updated with embedding guidelines
- [ ] **Responsive iframe** option works correctly

## Risk and Compatibility Assessment

### Primary Risk:

Security vulnerabilities through improper iframe configuration or CSP headers

### Mitigation:

- Implement conservative security attributes by default
- Comprehensive security testing of iframe embedding
- Review CSP and X-Frame-Options configuration thoroughly

### Rollback Plan:

- Embed code section can be hidden via feature flag
- Security headers can be reverted to restrictive defaults
- Component removal doesn't affect existing publishing workflow

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### Frontend Dependencies:

- `IframeEmbedGeneratorComponent` (new component)
- `PublishDialogComponent` enhancement
- Copy-to-clipboard utility from existing tools
- PrimeNG components for form controls and layout

### Backend Dependencies:

- Security headers configuration for iframe embedding
- Public form rendering route (existing)
- CSP policy updates for external embedding
- No API changes required (uses existing public URLs)

### External Dependencies:

- Modern browser iframe support
- External website CSP policies (user-controlled)
- No additional npm packages required

## Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Generate Basic Iframe Code

- **Given:** Form is published successfully
- **When:** User opens embed code section
- **Then:** Default iframe code generated with medium dimensions

### Scenario 2: Customize Iframe Dimensions

- **Given:** Embed code section is open
- **When:** User changes width/height settings
- **Then:** Iframe code updates in real-time

### Scenario 3: Copy Iframe Code

- **Given:** Iframe code is generated
- **When:** User clicks copy button
- **Then:** Code copied to clipboard with success feedback

### Scenario 4: Responsive Iframe Option

- **Given:** User selects responsive option
- **When:** Iframe code is generated
- **Then:** Code uses percentage-based width

### Scenario 5: External Website Embedding

- **Given:** Iframe code is copied
- **When:** Code is pasted into external website
- **Then:** Form renders correctly within iframe

### Scenario 6: Mobile Iframe Viewing

- **Given:** Iframe is embedded on external site
- **When:** Site viewed on mobile device
- **Then:** Form is responsive and usable within iframe
