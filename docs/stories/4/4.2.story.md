## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Data Models

**User Interface**: Document the User type with all properties and relationships for API extension
examples [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user] **Tenant Interface**: Document multi-tenancy
data model patterns for configuration guide [Source: architecture/data-models.md#tenant]

### API Specifications

**REST API Documentation**: Use existing OpenAPI 3.0 specification as foundation for comprehensive
API docs [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table] **Authentication Endpoints**:
Document JWT + Passport.js authentication flow for developer reference [Source:
architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Component Specifications

**Angular Components**: Document component organization patterns from `apps/web/src/app/` structure
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture] **State Management**:
Document NgRx Signals patterns for state management examples [Source:
architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### File Locations

- **Documentation Root**: `docs/` directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **API Documentation**: `docs/api/` directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Architecture Docs**: `docs/architecture.md` and related files [Source:
  architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **README**: Root `README.md` for getting started guide [Source:
  architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements

**Documentation Testing**: Verify all code examples in documentation are functional and up-to-date
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

### Technical Constraints

**Documentation Standards**: All public functions, interfaces, and classes MUST have JSDoc comments
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#documentation-standards] **API Documentation Format**: Use
OpenAPI 3.0 specification format [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table] **Code
Examples**: All examples must follow established coding standards and patterns [Source:
architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `docs/` directory for documentation, no specific test files required but
examples should be validated

**Test Standards**: All code examples in documentation must be syntactically correct and follow
project standards

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**: Documentation examples should align with Jest + Testing Library
for frontend and Jest + Supertest for backend [Source:
architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Specific Testing Requirements**: Validate that all API examples work with current codebase, ensure
architectural diagrams reflect actual implementation
