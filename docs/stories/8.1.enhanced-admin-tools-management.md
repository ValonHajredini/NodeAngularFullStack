# Story 8.1: Enhanced Admin Tools Management Interface

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** super administrator, **I want** a modern, intuitive tools management interface with
creation capabilities, **so that** I can efficiently view, manage, and create new tools without
technical complexity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Enhanced Tools Grid View**: Replace basic table with modern card-based grid showing tool icons,
   status, and key metrics
2. **Create New Tool Button**: Add prominent "Create New Tool" action that opens tool registration
   wizard
3. **Advanced Management Features**: Include search/filter functionality, bulk enable/disable
   actions, and detailed tool information modals
4. **Responsive Design**: Interface adapts gracefully to different screen sizes maintaining
   usability
5. Existing tools listing and enable/disable functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New interface follows existing PrimeNG component patterns and admin page styling
7. Integration with current admin tools service maintains all current API behavior
8. Enhanced UI is covered by component tests including user interactions
9. Existing tools management functionality regression tested thoroughly
10. Interface meets accessibility standards consistent with existing admin pages

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Enhance existing tools-settings page component** (AC: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Convert table view to modern card-based grid using PrimeNG Cards
  - [ ] Add tool icons, status indicators, and key metrics to cards
  - [ ] Implement "Create New Tool" button with proper routing
  - [ ] Maintain existing enable/disable functionality within new UI

- [ ] **Implement advanced management features** (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add search/filter functionality using PrimeNG components
  - [ ] Implement bulk enable/disable actions with selection checkboxes
  - [ ] Create detailed tool information modals using PrimeNG Dialog
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes

- [ ] **Testing and validation** (AC: 8, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Write component unit tests for new UI interactions
  - [ ] Add regression tests for existing functionality
  - [ ] Validate accessibility compliance using Angular CDK a11y
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous Epic 8 stories exist - this is the foundation story for the enhanced tools system.

### Data Models

**Tools Data Structure**: Based on existing tools infrastructure

- Tool entity with id, name, description, slug, icon, category, isEnabled fields
- API endpoint: `GET /api/admin/tools` returns list of tools for management
- Service methods: enable/disable operations via existing admin tools service [Source:
  epic-8-enhanced-admin-tool-registration.md#existing-infrastructure]

### API Specifications

**Admin Tools Management**:

- `GET /api/admin/tools` - List all tools (already exists)
- `PUT /api/admin/tools/:id` - Update tool status (already exists)
- Authentication: Super admin protected endpoints (already implemented)
- No API changes required for this story [Source:
  epic-8-enhanced-admin-tool-registration.md#api-endpoints]

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Architecture**:

- **Framework**: Angular 20+ with standalone components
- **UI Components**: PrimeNG 17+ (Cards, DataView, Dialog, Button, Checkbox, InputText)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design and spacing
- **State Management**: NgRx Signals for reactive tool state management
- **Testing**: Jest + Testing Library for component and interaction testing [Source:
  architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Component Structure**:

- Location: `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/tools-settings/`
- Follow standalone component pattern without NgModules
- Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for performance
- Implement reactive forms for search/filter functionality [Source:
  architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

### File Locations

**Enhancement Target**:

- Primary file: `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/tools-settings/tools-settings.page.ts`
- Component template: Inline template following project patterns
- Styling: Tailwind classes with optional component-scoped styles
- Service integration: Use existing admin tools service methods [Source:
  architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements

**Component Testing Strategy**:

- Test files location: Same directory as component with `.spec.ts` suffix
- Framework: Jest + Angular Testing Utilities
- Test coverage: Component interactions, service integration, UI state changes
- Mock existing admin tools service for unit tests
- Regression testing: Ensure existing functionality still works [Source:
  architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]

### Technical Constraints

**Integration Constraints**:

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing tools API endpoints
- Preserve all current admin service methods and behavior
- Follow existing PrimeNG component patterns used throughout admin section
- Use existing role-based authentication (super admin only)
- Maintain consistent styling with other admin pages [Source:
  epic-8-enhanced-admin-tool-registration.md#compatibility-requirements]

**Performance Requirements**:

- Card grid must handle current tool count efficiently
- Search/filter operations should be client-side for responsive UX
- Component should use OnPush change detection for optimal performance [Source:
  architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/tools-settings/tools-settings.page.spec.ts`

**Testing Standards**:

- Use Jest + Angular Testing Utilities
- Mock AdminToolsService for isolated component testing
- Test component initialization, user interactions, and state changes
- Include regression tests for existing enable/disable functionality
- Test responsive behavior and accessibility features

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**:

- Angular TestBed for component setup
- jasmine.createSpyObj for service mocking
- fixture.detectChanges() for change detection
- ComponentFixture for DOM interaction testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Test card grid rendering with mock tool data
- Test search/filter functionality
- Test "Create New Tool" button navigation
- Test bulk enable/disable operations
- Test tool information modal interactions
- Accessibility testing using Angular CDK a11y
