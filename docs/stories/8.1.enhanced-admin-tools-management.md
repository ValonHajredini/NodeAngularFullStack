## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous Epic 8 stories exist - this is the foundation story for the enhanced tools system.

### Data Models

**Tools Data Structure**: Based on existing tools infrastructure

- Tool entity with id, name, description, slug, icon, category, isEnabled fields
- API endpoint: `GET /api/admin/tools` returns list of tools for management
- Service methods: enable/disable operations via existing admin tools service [Source:
  epic-8-enhanced-admin-tool-registration.md#existing-infrastructure]

### API Specifications

**Admin Tools Management**:

- `GET /api/admin/tools` - List all tools (already exists)
- `PUT /api/admin/tools/:id` - Update tool status (already exists)
- Authentication: Super admin protected endpoints (already implemented)
- No API changes required for this story [Source:
  epic-8-enhanced-admin-tool-registration.md#api-endpoints]

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Architecture**:

- **Framework**: Angular 20+ with standalone components
- **UI Components**: PrimeNG 17+ (Cards, DataView, Dialog, Button, Checkbox, InputText)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design and spacing
- **State Management**: NgRx Signals for reactive tool state management
- **Testing**: Jest + Testing Library for component and interaction testing [Source:
  architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Component Structure**:

- Location: `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/tools-settings/`
- Follow standalone component pattern without NgModules
- Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for performance
- Implement reactive forms for search/filter functionality [Source:
  architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

### File Locations

**Enhancement Target**:

- Primary file: `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/tools-settings/tools-settings.page.ts`
- Component template: Inline template following project patterns
- Styling: Tailwind classes with optional component-scoped styles

  architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]

### Technical Constraints

**Integration Constraints**:

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing tools API endpoints
- Preserve all current admin service methods and behavior
- Follow existing PrimeNG component patterns used throughout admin section
- Use existing role-based authentication (super admin only)
- Maintain consistent styling with other admin pages [Source:
  epic-8-enhanced-admin-tool-registration.md#compatibility-requirements]

**Performance Requirements**:

- Card grid must handle current tool count efficiently
- Search/filter operations should be client-side for responsive UX
- Component should use OnPush change detection for optimal performance [Source:
  architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/tools-settings/tools-settings.page.spec.ts`

**Testing Standards**:

- Use Jest + Angular Testing Utilities
- Mock AdminToolsService for isolated component testing
- Test component initialization, user interactions, and state changes
- Include regression tests for existing enable/disable functionality
- Test responsive behavior and accessibility features

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**:

- Angular TestBed for component setup
- jasmine.createSpyObj for service mocking
- fixture.detectChanges() for change detection
- ComponentFixture for DOM interaction testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Test card grid rendering with mock tool data
- Test search/filter functionality
- Test "Create New Tool" button navigation
- Test bulk enable/disable operations
- Test tool information modal interactions
- Accessibility testing using Angular CDK a11y
