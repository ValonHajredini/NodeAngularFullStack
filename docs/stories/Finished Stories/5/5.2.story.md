# Story 5.2: Settings UI for Token Management

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** registered user, **I want** a simple interface in my profile settings to create, view, and
revoke API tokens, **so that** I can generate secure tokens for my external applications while
managing them easily.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Add "API Tokens" section to existing profile.component.ts with light, simple design matching
   current theme
2. Implement token generation form with fields: token name and simple scope selection (read/write)
3. Display existing tokens in a clean list showing: name, created date, last used date, and revoke
   button
4. Existing profile functionality (user info editing, password change) continues to work unchanged
5. New token section follows existing profile.component.ts form patterns and validation
6. Integration with existing AuthService maintains current user context and error handling
7. Token UI components covered by Angular component tests
8. Form validation follows existing pattern in profile component
9. No regression in existing profile functionality verified through existing tests

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 5.1 (API Token Backend Infrastructure) provides the backend endpoints and authentication
integration that this story will consume. The backend API provides `/api/v1/tokens` endpoints for
CRUD operations and extends AuthMiddleware for API token validation.

### Data Models

**Frontend Token Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md, story 5.1]:

```typescript
// Shared interfaces for frontend consumption
interface CreateTokenRequest {
  name: string;
  scopes: string[]; // ['read', 'write']
}

interface TokenResponse {
  id: string;
  token: string; // Only returned on creation
  name: string;
  scopes: string[];
  expiresAt: string;
  createdAt: string;
}

interface TokenListItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  scopes: string[];
  expiresAt: string;
  createdAt: string;
  lastUsedAt?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**Component State Management** [Source:
architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]:

- Use Angular signals for reactive token state management
- Implement computed signals for derived token list state
- Use signal-based forms for token creation form management

### API Specifications

**Token Service Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#service-example, story
5.1]:

```typescript
// Token service methods consuming backend API
createToken(request: CreateTokenRequest): Observable<TokenResponse>
getTokens(): Observable<TokenListItem[]>
revokeToken(tokenId: string): Observable<{ success: boolean }>
```

**HTTP Endpoints** [From story 5.1]:

- `POST /api/v1/tokens` - Create new API token
- `GET /api/v1/tokens` - List user's API tokens
- `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/:id` - Revoke API token

### Component Specifications

**Profile Component Integration** [Source:
architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:

- Extend existing ProfileComponent without breaking current functionality
- Add new section using existing component structure and styling
- Use standalone component pattern with proper imports
- Follow ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush for performance

**Form Implementation** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, components.md]:

- Use Angular reactive forms following existing profile form patterns
- Implement proper form validation with custom validators
- Use existing error handling and display patterns from profile component
