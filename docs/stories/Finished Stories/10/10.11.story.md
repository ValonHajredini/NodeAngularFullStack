# Story 10.11: Form Builder - Multiple Forms Management & Edit Workflow

## User Story

**As a** form creator, **I want** to create multiple forms and access them from a centralized list
to load and edit, **So that** I can manage multiple form projects efficiently without losing work or
starting from scratch each time.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- **Integrates with:** Form Builder component
  ([form-builder.component.ts:178](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L178)),
  Forms List component
  ([forms-list.component.ts:164](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/forms-list/forms-list.component.ts#L164)),
  Forms API Service
  ([forms-api.service.ts:16](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/forms-api.service.ts#L16))
- **Technology:** Angular 20+ standalone components, PrimeNG UI, RxJS observables, Express.js
  backend API
- **Follows pattern:** Feature-based architecture with service layer abstraction, repository pattern
  on backend
- **Touch points:**
  - Routes: [tools.routes.ts:10](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/tools.routes.ts#L10) (form-builder,
    form-builder/:id, form-builder/list)
  - Components: FormBuilderComponent (editor), FormsListComponent (list view)
  - Services: FormsApiService (CRUD operations), FormBuilderService (state management)
  - Backend: `/forms` API endpoints

---

## Current State Analysis

**What's Working:**

✅ **Create & Save Workflow:**

- Form Builder component creates new forms
  ([form-builder.component.ts:384](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L384))
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
  ([form-builder.component.ts:227](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L227))
- Manual save button functionality
- Forms persist to database via API

✅ **Forms List View:**

- Dedicated list component exists
  ([forms-list.component.ts:164](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/forms-list/forms-list.component.ts#L164))
- Paginated grid display (9 forms per page)
- Shows form metadata: title, description, status, field count, dates
- Delete functionality for draft forms
- "Edit" button navigates to form builder

✅ **Edit Existing Forms:**

- Load form by ID from route params
  ([form-builder.component.ts:206](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L206))
- Form settings restored from schema
- Unsaved changes guard prevents data loss
  ([form-builder.component.ts:448](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L448))

**What's Missing/Broken:**

❌ **Navigation & Discoverability:**

- No clear entry point from Form Builder to Forms List
- Users creating new forms may not realize list exists at `/tools/form-builder/list`
- Toolbar lacks "My Forms" or "Back to List" button

❌ **User Flow Gaps:**

- Creating first form doesn't guide users on how to find it later
- No breadcrumb or navigation hint showing relationship between builder and list

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. ✅ User can create multiple forms without losing previous work (already works)
2. ✅ User can navigate to Forms List view showing all their forms (component exists at route)
3. ✅ User can click "Edit" button on any form in the list to load it in Form Builder (works)
4. **NEW:** User sees "My Forms" button in Form Builder toolbar to open forms selection dialog
5. **NEW:** After creating/saving first form, user receives guidance about accessing Forms List

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Dialog button integrates seamlessly with existing toolbar
   ([form-builder.component.ts:44](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L44))
7. Forms List route (`/tools/form-builder/list`) remains accessible and functional (separate entry
   point)
8. Unsaved changes confirmation triggers when loading different form from dialog with dirty state

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Dialog approach provides quick form switching without full page navigation (UX trade-off: no URL
   bookmarking)
10. UI follows PrimeNG/Tailwind design patterns from existing code
11. No regression in save, load, delete, or publish functionality
12. Accessibility: keyboard navigation (Escape to close) and screen reader support for dialog

---

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**

Add "My Forms" button to Form Builder toolbar that opens an embedded dialog for quick form
switching. Uses PrimeNG Dialog component with inline form selection, avoiding full page navigation
for better workflow continuity.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Toolbar Button Addition:**
   - Location:
     [form-builder.component.ts:52-60](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L52-L60)
     (toolbar section)
   - Button added after "Form Builder" heading, before settings/preview/publish buttons
   - Uses PrimeNG `pButton` with `icon="pi pi-list"` and `severity="secondary"`

2. **Dialog-Based Implementation:**

   ```typescript
   // Opens dialog and fetches user's forms
   openFormsDialog(): void {
     this.formsListDialogVisible.set(true);
     this.fetchAvailableForms();
   }

   // Handles form selection with dirty state confirmation
   onFormSelected(form: FormMetadata): void {
     if (this.formBuilderService.isDirty()) {
       const confirmSwitch = window.confirm(
         'You have unsaved changes. Loading another form will discard them. Continue?'
       );
       if (!confirmSwitch) return;
     }
     this.formsListDialogVisible.set(false);
     this.loadExistingForm(form.id, { updateRoute: true });
   }
   ```

3. **Dialog Features:**
   - Loading states with spinners
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Empty state when no forms exist
   - Delete confirmation workflow
   - Keyboard accessibility (Escape to close)

**Existing Pattern Reference:**

- Dialog pattern: See PrimeNG Dialog implementation in existing components
- Toolbar button pattern: See existing buttons in
  [form-builder.component.ts:63-111](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L63-L111)
- Form loading: Uses existing `loadExistingForm()` method from component

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Dialog vs Route Navigation:** Chose dialog approach for quick form switching without losing
  builder context
- **UX Trade-offs Accepted:**
  - ✅ Faster workflow (no full page load)
  - ✅ Maintains builder UI context
  - ❌ No browser back button support
  - ❌ No URL bookmarking/sharing
  - ❌ No deep linking to forms list
- **Unsaved Changes Handling:** Manual confirmation in `onFormSelected()` instead of route guard
- **Button Visibility:** Always visible (not conditionally hidden)
- **Separate List Route:** `/tools/form-builder/list` route remains available as alternative entry
  point

- **Rollback:** Simply remove the button and navigation method

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] No database changes required
- [x] UI change follows existing PrimeNG button patterns
      ([form-builder.component.ts:63-111](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-builder.component.ts#L63-L111))
- [x] Performance impact negligible (single button addition)

---

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (~2 hours)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward (add button + navigation method)
- [x] Follows existing Angular routing and component patterns exactly
- [x] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**
