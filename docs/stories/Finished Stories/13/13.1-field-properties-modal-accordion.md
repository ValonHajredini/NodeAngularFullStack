# Story 13.1: Field Properties Modal with Accordion Sections

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** form builder user, **I want** field properties to open in a modal dialog instead of the
right sidebar, **so that** I have more canvas space and a cleaner, more focused editing experience
with organized accordion sections.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ When a field is clicked on the canvas, a modal dialog opens displaying field properties
   (instead of right sidebar)
2. ✅ The modal contains accordion sections organizing properties:
   - **Basic Properties** (label, field name, placeholder, help text)
   - **Validation** (required, min/max values, patterns, email format)
   - **Behavior** (disabled, read-only, default value)
   - **Conditional Visibility** (show if rules)
   - **Options** (for select/radio fields)
   - **File Upload Settings** (for file fields)
3. ✅ Modal has "Save" and "Cancel" buttons at the bottom
4. ✅ Changes are applied when "Save" is clicked (not live as currently implemented)
5. ✅ Modal can be closed via close button, cancel button, or ESC key
6. ✅ The right sidebar is removed from the three-panel layout
7. ✅ Existing field editing functionality continues to work unchanged
8. ✅ New modal follows existing PrimeNG Dialog pattern used in form-settings and publish dialogs
9. ✅ Integration with `FormBuilderService` maintains current behavior for field selection and
   updates
10. ✅ Modal is responsive and works well on different screen sizes
11. ✅ Accordion sections are collapsible/expandable for better organization
12. ✅ All existing validators and form controls are preserved
13. ✅ No regression in existing field editing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach

- **Refactor Strategy**: Convert `field-properties.component.ts` from a sidebar component to a modal
  dialog component
- **Modal Implementation**: Use PrimeNG `p-dialog` with `p-accordion` for organized sections
- **Layout Update**: Remove right sidebar from `form-builder.component.ts` (currently
  `<div class="w-80 flex-shrink-0">`)
- **Behavior Change**: Switch from live updates (debounced) to save-on-click pattern
- **State Management**: Add modal visibility signal to `FormBuilderService`

### Existing Pattern References

- [form-settings.component.ts](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-settings/form-settings.component.ts) -
  Modal with save/cancel pattern
- [publish-dialog.component.ts](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/publish-dialog/publish-dialog.component.ts) -
  Dialog structure and visibility management

### Key Constraints

- Must preserve all existing field validation logic
- Monaco editor (for custom HTML/CSS) must work inside modal (if still needed)
- Drag-and-drop for options must work inside modal accordion
- Form state must not be lost when modal is closed without saving
- All existing EventEmitters and Outputs must be preserved

### Component Structure

```
form-builder/
├── field-properties-modal.component.ts  (NEW - replaces sidebar)
├── field-properties.component.ts        (OLD - to be deprecated/removed)
├── form-builder.component.ts            (UPDATED - remove right sidebar)
├── form-canvas/
│   └── form-canvas.component.ts         (UPDATED - click opens modal)
└── form-builder.service.ts              (UPDATED - add modal visibility signal)
```

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: `form-builder.component.ts` (main three-panel layout),
  `field-properties.component.ts` (current right sidebar)
- Technology: Angular 20+ standalone components, PrimeNG UI library (Dialog, Accordion), Reactive
  Forms, Signals
- Follows pattern: Existing modal pattern used in form-settings and publish dialogs
- Touch points:
  - `form-builder.component.ts` (parent component managing layout)
  - `form-canvas.component.ts` (field click triggers properties modal)
  - `field-properties.component.ts` (to be refactored into modal)

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing field property editing workflow or losing form state
- **Mitigation**: Preserve all existing reactive form logic and validators; use existing modal
  patterns; implement save-on-click to prevent accidental data loss
- **Rollback**: Revert to right sidebar layout by undoing template and service changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to `FormBuilderService` API
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns (PrimeNG Dialog + Accordion)
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (modal rendering is lazy)
- [ ] All existing EventEmitters and Outputs preserved

- Form validation
- Responsive design on different screen sizes

### Change Log

**2025-10-09:**

- Created field-properties-modal.component.ts with full form logic migration

- Added fieldPropertiesModalVisible and selectedFieldForModal signals
- Implemented onFieldPropertiesSaved, onFieldPropertiesCancelled,
  onFieldPropertiesModalVisibleChange handlers
- Preserved all existing validators and reactive form controls
