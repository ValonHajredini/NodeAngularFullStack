## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 6.1 provides the StorageService backend foundation, and Story 6.2 provides the API endpoints
for avatar upload (`POST /api/v1/users/avatar`), deletion (`DELETE /api/v1/users/avatar`), and
profile retrieval with avatar_url. This story builds the user-facing interface to interact with
those endpoints.

### Data Models

**Updated User Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user, Story 6.2]:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'readonly';
  tenantId?: string;
  avatarUrl?: string; // New field from Story 6.2
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  lastLogin?: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
  emailVerified: boolean;
}
```

**Avatar Upload Component State** [Source:
architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:

```typescript
interface AvatarUploadState {
  selectedFile: File | null;
  uploading: boolean;
  uploadProgress: number;
  error: string | null;
  previewUrl: string | null;
}
```

**File Upload Request** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]:

```typescript
interface AvatarUploadRequest {
  avatar: File;
}

interface AvatarUploadResponse {
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    user: User;
    avatarUrl: string;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications

**Frontend API Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#api-client-setup, Story
6.2]:

```typescript
// Avatar API endpoints to integrate with
uploadAvatar(file: File): Observable<AvatarUploadResponse> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('avatar', file);
  return this.api.post<AvatarUploadResponse>('/users/avatar', formData);
}

deleteAvatar(): Observable<{ success: boolean; data: { user: User } }> {
  return this.api.delete('/users/avatar');
}
```

**HTTP Client Configuration** [Source:
architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]:

- Use existing HTTP interceptors for authentication
- Handle multipart/form-data upload with FormData
- Include proper error handling for upload failures
- Use existing API client patterns for consistency

### Component Specifications

**Angular 20+ Standalone Component Pattern** [Source:
architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-avatar-upload',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, ReactiveFormsModule, FileUploadModule, ButtonModule],
  template: `
    <div class="avatar-upload-container">
      <!-- Avatar upload UI -->
    </div>
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class AvatarUploadComponent {
  private readonly usersService = inject(UsersService);
  private readonly destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

  protected readonly uploadState = signal<AvatarUploadState>({
    selectedFile: null,
    uploading: false,
    uploadProgress: 0,
    error: null,
    previewUrl: null,
  });
}
```

**PrimeNG FileUpload Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:

```typescript
// Use PrimeNG 17+ FileUpload component
import { FileUploadModule } from 'primeng/fileupload';
import { ButtonModule } from 'primeng/button';
import { ProgressBarModule } from 'primeng/progressbar';
import { MessageModule } from 'primeng/message';
```

**Reactive Forms Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:

- Use Angular reactive forms for file upload handling
- Implement custom validators for file type and size
- Follow existing form validation patterns in profile.component.ts
- Integrate with existing error handling mechanisms
