# Story 24.1: Audit Current Theme CSS Variable Usage Across All Field Types

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a comprehensive audit documenting which field types currently use theme CSS variables vs.
hardcoded styles,  
**so that** I can efficiently implement theme support where it's missing and prioritize the most
impactful improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Audit Document Created**: Spreadsheet/markdown table listing all 16 field types with columns:
   - Field Type
   - Component Path
   - CSS Variable Usage (Yes/No/Partial)
   - Hardcoded Styles Found
   - Priority (High/Medium/Low)

2. **Gap Analysis**: Document identifies specific CSS properties that need theme variable conversion
   for each field type

3. **Priority Matrix**: Fields categorized as:
   - **High Priority**: TEXT, EMAIL, NUMBER, TEXTAREA, SELECT (most commonly used)
   - **Medium Priority**: CHECKBOX, RADIO, DATE, DATETIME, TOGGLE, FILE
   - **Low Priority**: IMAGE_GALLERY, HEADING, IMAGE, TEXT_BLOCK, DIVIDER

4. **Baseline Tests**: Create visual regression test screenshots for each field type with current
   theme application

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Review form-renderer.component.scss for existing theme variable usage (AC: 1)
  - [x] Document current CSS variable usage in form-renderer.component.scss

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories in Epic 24 - this is the foundation story for the entire epic.

### Data Models

**Theme CSS Variables** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#css-framework]:

- 40+ CSS variables defined in ThemePreviewService.applyThemeCss()
- Variables include: --theme-primary-color, --theme-input-background, --theme-input-border-color,
  --theme-input-text-color, --theme-label-color, --theme-help-text-color, --theme-body-font,
  --theme-heading-font, --theme-border-radius, --theme-field-spacing
- Mobile responsive overrides via media query (@media (max-width: 767px))

### API Specifications

**Theme Application Flow** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:

- FormBuilderComponent applies theme via FormBuilderService.applyTheme()
- ThemePreviewService injects CSS variables into document :root
- FormRendererComponent loads theme data from API for published forms
- Theme data stored in form.schema.settings.themeId (UUID reference)

### Component Specifications

**Field Type Components** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Form builder field previews:
  `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/field-preview-renderer/`
- Public form field renderers: `apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/`
- Theme service: `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/theme-preview.service.ts`
- Form renderer: `apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/form-renderer.component.ts`

**16 Field Types to Audit**:

1. TEXT (text-input-preview.component.ts)
2. EMAIL (email-input-preview.component.ts)
3. NUMBER (number-input-preview.component.ts)
4. TEXTAREA (textarea-preview.component.ts)
5. SELECT (select-preview.component.ts)
6. RADIO (radio-preview.component.ts)
7. CHECKBOX (checkbox-preview.component.ts)
8. DATE (date-preview.component.ts)
9. DATETIME (datetime-preview.component.ts)
10. TOGGLE (toggle-preview.component.ts)
11. FILE (file-preview.component.ts)
12. IMAGE_GALLERY (image-gallery-preview.component.ts)
13. HEADING (heading-preview.component.ts)
14. IMAGE (image-preview.component.ts)
15. TEXT_BLOCK (text-block-preview.component.ts)
16. DIVIDER (divider-preview.component.ts)

### File Locations

**Key Files to Review** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- `apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/form-renderer.component.scss` - Main form renderer
  styles
- `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/theme-preview.service.ts` - Theme CSS
  injection service
- `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/form-canvas/field-preview-renderer/` -
  Field preview components directory
- `apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/` - Public form field renderers directory

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]:

- Test files located beside implementation files (\*.spec.ts)
- Use Angular testing utilities with TestBed
- Component testing with Jasmine + Karma
- Visual regression testing with Playwright for E2E scenarios
- Screenshot comparison for theme application verification

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:

- Manual audit of CSS files (no automated tests needed)
- Visual regression test screenshots for baseline comparison
- Documentation of current state for future reference

### Technical Constraints

**CSS Variable Strategy** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#css-framework]:

- Use CSS custom properties with fallback values: `var(--theme-primary-color, #3b82f6)`
- PrimeNG component overrides require ::ng-deep with component scoping
- Mobile responsive themes via media query breakpoint (767px)
- Graceful degradation when theme variables not available

**Performance Considerations**:

- CSS variables are native browser feature (highly performant)
- Theme application should complete in <50ms for forms with 50+ fields
- No performance testing required for audit story

### Project Structure Notes

All file paths align with the unified project structure. Form builder components are properly
organized under `apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/` and public form renderers
under `apps/web/src/app/features/public/form-renderer/`.

## Testing

**Manual Audit Process**:

1. Review each field type component's SCSS file
2. Document current CSS variable usage vs. hardcoded values
3. Create comprehensive audit table/spreadsheet
4. Capture baseline screenshots for visual regression testing

**Deliverables**:

- Audit spreadsheet/table with all 16 field types
- Gap analysis document identifying conversion needs
- Priority matrix for implementation order
- Baseline visual regression test screenshots
