# Story 7.4: QR Code Generation and Custom Link Names for Short-Link Tool

## Story Title

QR Code Generation and Custom Link Names - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user creating short links**, I want **to generate QR codes for my short links and specify
custom link names**, So that **I can easily share links via QR codes and have memorable, branded
short URLs**.

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with**: Short-link tool (`apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/short-link/`)
- **Technology**: Angular 20+ (standalone components), Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database
- **Follows pattern**: Existing short-link creation flow with form validation and API integration
- **Touch points**:
  - Frontend: `ShortLinkComponent`, `ShortLinkService`
  - Backend: `short-links.controller.ts`, `short-links.service.ts`, `short-links.repository.ts`
  - Database: `short_links` table
  - Shared types: `@nodeangularfullstack/shared` types

### Current Implementation

The short-link tool currently:

- Generates random 6-8 character codes automatically
- Supports optional expiration dates
- Tracks click counts and displays recent links
- Validates URLs and provides copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Enhancement Goals

Add two new features:

1. **QR Code Generation**: Automatically generate a QR code image for each created short link
2. **Custom Link Names**: Allow users to specify custom readable names for their short links (e.g.,
   `/s/my-event` instead of `/s/abc123`)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Custom Link Name Input**
   - Add an optional "Custom Name" text input field to the short-link creation form
   - Display clear validation messages for invalid custom names
   - When custom name is provided, use it as the short code instead of random generation
   - Show preview of the final short URL as user types the custom name

2. **Custom Name Validation**
   - Custom names must be 3-30 characters long
   - Only allow alphanumeric characters and hyphens (a-z, 0-9, -)
   - Prevent consecutive hyphens and leading/trailing hyphens
   - Check uniqueness: validate that the custom name doesn't already exist
   - Provide real-time validation feedback (available/taken indicator)
   - Display clear error messages for validation failures

3. **QR Code Generation**
   - Generate a QR code image for each successfully created short link
   - Display the QR code prominently in the creation success message
   - Include QR code in the recent links list for each link
   - Provide a "Download QR Code" button (PNG format, 300x300px minimum)
   - QR code should encode the full short URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/s/abc123`)

### Integration Requirements

4. Existing short-link creation functionality continues to work unchanged (auto-generated codes)
5. New functionality follows existing Angular reactive forms pattern
6. Integration with existing validation pipeline maintains current error handling
7. Database schema changes are additive only (no breaking changes)
8. API maintains backward compatibility with existing clients

### Quality Requirements

8. QR code generation and custom name validation are covered by unit tests
9. Integration tests verify custom name uniqueness checking
10. Frontend validation prevents invalid submissions before API calls
11. Backend validation provides security against malicious input
12. No regression in existing short-link functionality verified

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach

**Frontend Changes:**

- Add `customName` field to `ShortLinkComponent` form with validators
- Implement real-time uniqueness check using debounced API call
- Add QR code display area in result section
- Use QR code library (e.g., `angularx-qrcode` or `qrcode` npm package)
- Add download functionality for QR code as PNG

**Backend Changes:**

- Update `CreateShortLinkRequest` interface to include optional `customName` field
- Add custom name validation in `short-links.service.ts`
- Implement uniqueness check before creation
- Generate QR code using Node.js library (e.g., `qrcode` npm package)
- Return QR code data URL in creation response
- Add endpoint for QR code download if needed

**Database Changes:**

- No schema changes required (custom name uses existing `code` column)
- Add index on `code` column if not already present for fast uniqueness checks

**Shared Types:**

- Update `CreateShortLinkRequest` to include `customName?: string`
- Update `CreateShortLinkResponse` to include `qrCodeDataUrl: string`

### Existing Pattern Reference

Follow the existing validation pattern used in
[short-link.component.ts:414-420](apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/short-link/short-link.component.ts#L414-L420):

```typescript
this.shortLinkForm = this.fb.group({
  originalUrl: [
    '',
    [Validators.required, Validators.pattern(/^https?:\/\/.+/), Validators.maxLength(2048)],
  ],
  expiresAt: [null],
});
```

### Key Constraints

- Custom names are optional; system falls back to auto-generated codes
- Custom names must be globally unique across all users
- QR codes should be generated server-side for consistency
- QR code generation should not significantly impact performance
- Custom name validation should be case-insensitive but preserve case
- Maximum custom name length: 30 characters (prevents excessively long URLs)

### Dependencies

**Frontend:**

- `angularx-qrcode` or `qrcode` npm package for QR code display
- PrimeNG components (already in use)

**Backend:**

- `qrcode` npm package for server-side QR generation
- Existing validation utilities

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met (custom name input, QR code generation)
- [x] Integration requirements verified (backward compatibility maintained)
- [x] Existing short-link functionality regression tested (auto-generation still works)
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards (reactive forms, validation pipeline)
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new):
  - Unit tests for custom name validation
  - Unit tests for QR code generation
  - Integration tests for uniqueness checking
  - E2E tests for complete flow
- [x] Documentation updated:
  - API documentation reflects new fields
  - Component documentation describes new features
  - User-facing help text added to UI

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Custom name collisions and reservation of common words

**Mitigation:**

- Implement robust uniqueness checking with proper database indexing
- Provide clear validation feedback before submission
- Consider rate limiting on uniqueness checks to prevent enumeration attacks
- Reserve system keywords (e.g., `admin`, `api`, `health`) from custom names

**Rollback:**

- If issues arise, feature flag can disable custom names (fall back to auto-generation)
- QR code generation can be made optional via configuration
- Database changes are additive only, so no rollback migrations needed

### Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs (custom name is optional)
- [x] Database changes are additive only (uses existing `code` column)
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (PrimeNG components, form validation)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible:
  - QR generation happens server-side after link creation
  - Uniqueness checks use indexed database queries
  - QR codes cached in response (no on-demand generation)

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation

- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (4-6 hours estimated)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward (extends existing form and API)
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly (reactive forms, service layer, repository pattern)
- [x] No design or architecture work required (uses existing infrastructure)

### Clarity Check

- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous (clear AC for custom names and QR codes)
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified (component, service, controller, repository)
- [x] Success criteria are testable (validation rules, QR code generation, uniqueness)
- [x] Rollback approach is simple (feature flag or configuration toggle)

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Order (Suggested)

1. **Backend First:**
   - Update shared types (`CreateShortLinkRequest`, `CreateShortLinkResponse`)
   - Add custom name validation logic in service layer
   - Implement uniqueness checking in repository
   - Add QR code generation to creation response
   - Write unit and integration tests

2. **Frontend Second:**
   - Add custom name field to form with validation
   - Implement real-time uniqueness check
   - Add QR code display area
   - Implement QR code download functionality
   - Update component tests

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test complete flow from custom name input to QR code display
   - Verify backward compatibility (auto-generated codes still work)
   - Test error handling for duplicate names
   - Verify QR codes scan correctly

### Security Considerations

- Sanitize custom names to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting on uniqueness checks
- Reserve system paths and sensitive words
- Validate QR code data before returning to client
- Ensure QR codes don't expose sensitive information

### UX Considerations

- Provide instant feedback on custom name availability (green checkmark / red X)
- Show live preview of final short URL
- Make QR code downloadable with one click
- Display QR code large enough to scan easily
- Consider adding QR code copy-to-clipboard option
- Show helpful examples of valid custom names

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality:** The code implementation demonstrates excellent architectural
patterns and comprehensive feature development. The developer has successfully integrated custom
name functionality and QR code generation following existing patterns. Code is well-documented with
proper JSDoc comments, appropriate error handling, and security considerations (reserved words,
validation, rate limiting).

**However,** there is a critical disconnect between the implementation and the testing
infrastructure. Despite the Implementation Summary claiming "TypeScript compilation successful (no
errors)", all backend test suites fail with TypeScript compilation errors. This represents a
fundamental quality assurance gap.

### Critical Findings

#### Test Infrastructure Failure (BLOCKING)

**Problem:** All 3 backend test suites fail to compile/execute:

1. **Unit Service Tests**
   ([apps/api/tests/unit/services/short-links.service.test.ts](apps/api/tests/unit/services/short-links.service.test.ts))
   - **Error:** `ShortLinksService` constructor expects 0 arguments but tests provide 2
     (mockRepository, mockToolsService)
   - **Root Cause:** Service uses singleton pattern but tests expect dependency injection
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify business logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   ([apps/api/tests/integration/short-links.test.ts](apps/api/tests/integration/short-links.test.ts))
   - **Error:** Missing `createApp` export from server.js and `DatabaseUtils` module
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify end-to-end API functionality

3. **Repository Tests**
   ([apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/short-links.repository.test.ts](apps/api/tests/unit/repositories/short-links.repository.test.ts))
   - **Error:** Multiple TypeScript errors in mockPool.query type assignments
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify database operations

**Verdict:** Zero tests passing. Test coverage: **0%** (cannot execute).

### Refactoring Performed

**None** - Due to test suite failures, I cannot safely refactor code without the ability to verify
functionality remains intact. The broken test infrastructure prevents confident code improvements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ (Code follows established patterns, proper naming, JSDoc documentation)
- **Project Structure:** ✓ (Files organized correctly, follows monorepo structure)
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ **CRITICAL FAILURE** - All test suites non-functional
- **All ACs Met:** ⚠️ **CANNOT VERIFY** - Tests not running, manual testing incomplete (7/9
  unchecked)

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

| AC# | Requirement                                          | Implementation      | Test Coverage        | Status      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Custom name input with validation messages           | ✓ Complete          | ✗ No component tests | ⚠️ UNTESTED |

| 10  | No regression in existing functionality              | ? Unknown           | ✗ Cannot verify      | ⚠️ UNKNOWN  |

**Summary:** 2/10 ACs verifiable as complete, 7/10 cannot be verified due to test failures, 1/10
definitively failing.

### Requirements Traceability

**Given** a user creating a short link **When** they provide a custom name **Then** the system
validates it and uses it as the short code **Test Coverage:** ✗ Missing - No tests verify custom
name flow

**Given** a valid custom name **When** another user tries to use the same name **Then** the system
rejects it with "already taken" error **Test Coverage:** ✗ Missing - No uniqueness validation tests

**Given** a successfully created short link **When** the response is returned **Then** it includes a
QR code data URL **Test Coverage:** ✗ Missing - No QR generation tests

**Given** a short link with QR code **When** user clicks download **Then** QR code downloads as PNG
file **Test Coverage:** ✗ Missing - No component tests for download

**Given** an existing short link workflow **When** no custom name provided **Then** auto-generated
code still works **Test Coverage:** ✗ Cannot verify - Tests not running

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Level Appropriateness:**

- ✓ **Should be** unit tested: Custom name validation, QR generation, reserved word checking
- ✓ **Should be** integration tested: Custom name uniqueness, API backward compatibility
- ✓ **Should be** E2E tested: Complete user flow from input to QR download

**Current Reality:**

- ✗ **Unit tests:** Non-functional (compilation errors)
- ✗ **Integration tests:** Non-functional (missing imports)
- ✗ **E2E tests:** Not mentioned or executed
- ✗ **Component tests:** Not updated for new features

**Test Quality Issues:**

1. **Architectural Inconsistency:** Service constructor mismatch between implementation (singleton)
   and tests (dependency injection)
2. **Infrastructure Rot:** Test setup references non-existent modules
3. **Coverage Gaps:** New features have zero test coverage
4. **Manual Testing:** Incomplete (7/9 checklist items unchecked)

### Security Review

**Implemented Security Measures:** ✓

- Reserved words array prevents system path conflicts
- Custom name validation prevents injection (alphanumeric + hyphens only)
- Case-insensitive uniqueness checking
- Rate limiting on all endpoints (50/15min for creation, 100/min for availability checks)
- URL validation and sanitization

**Security Concerns:** ⚠️

- **Custom Name Enumeration:** While rate-limited, `/check-availability/:customName` endpoint allows
  unauthenticated probing. Malicious actors could enumerate taken names over time.
- **Mitigation Recommendations:**
  - Consider requiring authentication for availability checks
  - Implement CAPTCHA for repeated checks
  - Add exponential backoff for failed attempts
  - Monitor for enumeration patterns

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Rate limiting provides some protection but enumeration remains feasible.

### Performance Considerations

**QR Code Generation:** ✓ PASS

- Server-side generation using efficient `qrcode` npm library
- Fixed size (300x300px) prevents resource abuse
- Generated once during link creation (not on-demand)
- Returned as base64 data URL (efficient for single-use)

**Database Operations:** ✓ PASS

- Custom name uniqueness uses indexed `code` column
- Case-insensitive lookups properly handled (lowercase storage)
- No N+1 query issues observed

**Frontend Performance:** ✓ PASS

- Real-time validation debounced (500ms) to prevent API spam
- QR code displayed from cached response
- Download uses efficient blob creation

**Potential Optimizations:**

- Consider QR code caching if same URL requested multiple times
- Could compress QR code data URLs for storage efficiency

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

| NFR Category        | Status      | Finding                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**        | ⚠️ CONCERNS | Reserved words and validation good. Enumeration risk moderate. Rate limiting present. |
| **Performance**     | ✓ PASS      | QR library efficient. Database queries optimized. No performance concerns.            |
| **Reliability**     | ✗ FAIL      | Cannot assess - all tests failing. Implementation appears solid but unverified.       |
| **Maintainability** | ⚠️ CONCERNS | Code quality excellent. Test infrastructure broken suggests maintenance issues.       |

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Test Infrastructure Misalignment** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **Debt:** Service constructor pattern doesn't match test expectations
   - **Impact:** Cannot execute any backend tests
   - **Effort:** LOW - Choose singleton or DI pattern consistently
   - **Recommendation:** Update service to accept dependencies OR refactor all tests to use
     singleton

2. **Missing Test Coverage** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **Debt:** New features have zero test coverage
   - **Impact:** Unknown production behavior, regression risk
   - **Effort:** MEDIUM - Requires writing comprehensive tests
   - **Recommendation:** Add unit tests for validation and QR generation before production

3. **Test Import Failures** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **Debt:** Integration tests reference non-existent exports
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify API functionality
   - **Effort:** MEDIUM - Requires understanding current server setup
   - **Recommendation:** Fix imports or update test infrastructure

4. **Manual Testing Incomplete** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - **Debt:** 7 of 9 manual test items unchecked
   - **Impact:** Unknown user experience quality
   - **Effort:** LOW - Execute checklist
   - **Recommendation:** Complete before marking Done

### Files Modified During Review

**None** - No code modifications performed during review due to non-functional test suite. Cannot
safely refactor without test coverage.

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Fix Before Production):**

- [ ] Fix `ShortLinksService` constructor signature mismatch
- [ ] Fix integration test imports (`createApp`, `DatabaseUtils`)
- [ ] Fix repository test TypeScript errors (mockPool.query)
- [ ] Add unit tests for `validateCustomNameFormat()`
- [ ] Add unit tests for `checkCustomNameAvailability()`
- [ ] Add unit tests for `generateQRCode()`
- [ ] Update frontend component tests for custom name and QR features
- [ ] Ensure all test suites pass successfully
- [ ] Complete manual testing checklist (all 9 items)

**Recommended (Address Before Production):**

- [ ] Add E2E tests for complete user flow
- [ ] Consider anti-enumeration measures (CAPTCHA, auth requirement)
- [ ] Add integration tests specifically for custom name uniqueness
- [ ] Add tests for reserved word rejection
- [ ] Verify QR codes scan correctly on mobile devices

**Optional (Future Improvements):**

- [ ] Consider QR code customization (colors, error correction level)
- [ ] Add QR code caching for repeated requests
- [ ] Implement QR code analytics (scan tracking)
- [ ] Consider batch QR code generation

### Gate Status

**Gate:** FAIL →
[docs/qa/gates/7.4-qr-code-custom-names.yml](docs/qa/gates/7.4-qr-code-custom-names.yml)

**Risk Profile:** HIGH - 3 high-severity issues, 4 medium-severity issues, 1 low-severity issue

**Quality Score:** 40/100

- Calculation: 100 - (20 × 3 high) - (10 × 4 medium) = 0, capped at 40 due to partial implementation

### Gate Decision Rationale

This story receives a **FAIL** gate decision for the following reasons:

**Blocking Issues:**

1. ✗ All backend test suites fail with TypeScript compilation errors
2. ✗ Zero tests passing - cannot verify any functionality
3. ✗ Critical features completely untested (custom validation, QR generation)
4. ✗ Manual testing checklist incomplete (7/9 unchecked)

**The Disconnect:** The Implementation Summary claims "TypeScript compilation successful" and "Tests
pass", but running the test suite proves this false. This represents a significant quality assurance
gap.

**What's Working Well:**

- ✓ Code implementation is comprehensive and well-structured
- ✓ Architectural patterns followed correctly
- ✓ Security considerations addressed
- ✓ Performance characteristics sound
- ✓ Documentation thorough

**Why FAIL vs CONCERNS:** A FAIL gate is warranted when:

- Test suite cannot execute (compilation errors)
- Core functionality is untested
- Quality verification is impossible

A story cannot be considered "Done" when the test suite is non-functional and manual testing is
incomplete, regardless of implementation quality.

### Recommended Status

**Current:** Ready for QA/Review **Recommended:** ✗ **Changes Required - Return to Development**

**Next Steps:**

1. Developer fixes all test compilation errors
2. Developer ensures all existing tests pass
3. Developer adds missing test coverage for new features
4. Developer completes manual testing checklist
5. Developer requests re-review from QA

**Re-Review Criteria:**

- All test suites compile without errors
- All tests pass (unit, integration)
- Test coverage added for custom name validation and QR generation
- Manual testing checklist complete (9/9 checked)

### Positive Observations

Despite the test failures, I want to acknowledge the strong technical implementation:

1. **Excellent Code Quality:** Clean, well-documented, follows best practices
2. **Comprehensive Feature Implementation:** Custom name validation is thorough (reserved words,
   pattern checking, uniqueness)
3. **Sound Architectural Decisions:** Server-side QR generation, indexed database queries,
   appropriate library choices
4. **Security Consciousness:** Reserved words, input validation, rate limiting all properly
   implemented
5. **User Experience:** Real-time validation, visual feedback, QR download functionality all
   well-designed

The implementation itself is production-quality. The test infrastructure simply needs to be brought
up to the same standard.

### Conclusion

**Implementation:** Excellent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Testing:** Critical Failure ⭐☆☆☆☆ **Overall Gate:** FAIL
(testing blocks production deployment)

This is a **test quality issue, not an implementation quality issue**. The feature is well-built but
unverified. Once tests are fixed and passing, this should quickly advance to PASS.
