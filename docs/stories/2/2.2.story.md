# infrastructure/docker-compose.yml
services:
  pgweb:
    image: sosedoff/pgweb:latest
    container_name: pgweb
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'

### Database Schema Integration

[Source: architecture/data-models.md] **Existing Database Tables to Manage:**

```sql
-- Core tables that pgWeb will visualize
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR,
  first_name VARCHAR,
  last_name VARCHAR,
  role user_role_enum,
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,

  created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### pgWeb Configuration Requirements

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md] **Security Configuration:**

- Authentication required for production environments
- Read-only access for production databases
- Full access allowed only in development environment
- Connection pooling and timeout configuration
- SSL encryption for database connections

**Access Control Pattern:**

```bash
# Environment-specific access
PGWEB_AUTH_USER=admin
PGWEB_AUTH_PASS=development_password
PGWEB_READ_ONLY=false  # Development only
PGWEB_SESSIONS=true
PGWEB_CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:4200
```

### Development Workflow Integration

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md] **Database Development Commands:**

```bash
# Start pgWeb with database
docker-compose up postgres pgweb

# Access pgWeb interface
open http://localhost:8080

# Execute database migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed database with test data
npm run seed
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `PGWEB_AUTH_USER`: pgWeb authentication username
- `PGWEB_AUTH_PASS`: pgWeb authentication password
- `PGWEB_DATABASE_URL`: Database connection for pgWeb

### Data Export/Import Specifications

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md] **Export Formats Supported:**

- CSV: For spreadsheet compatibility
- JSON: For application data exchange
- SQL: For database backup and migration
- TSV: For tab-separated value files

**Import Validation Requirements:**

- Data type validation for all columns
- Foreign key constraint verification
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Error logging and rollback capabilities

### User Management Interface Requirements

[Source: architecture/data-models.md] **User Management Operations:**

- View all users with role, status, and tenant information
- Modify user roles: admin, user, readonly
- Activate/deactivate user accounts (is_active field)
- Edit user profile information (first_name, last_name)
- View user session history and login activity
- Manage tenant associations for multi-tenancy

**Seed User Data Display:**

```
Admin User: admin@example.com (role: admin, active: true)
Regular User: user@example.com (role: user, active: true)
Read-Only User: readonly@example.com (role: readonly, active: true)
```

### Security and Performance Considerations

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md] **Security Measures:**
