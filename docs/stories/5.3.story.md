# Story 5.3: API Token Authentication Integration

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As an** external software developer, **I want** to use API tokens to authenticate API requests and
have usage tracked, **so that** my software can securely access the system's APIs with proper
monitoring and accountability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Apply API token authentication to existing protected routes alongside JWT session auth
2. Implement basic usage logging to track API token requests (timestamp, endpoint, token_id,
   success/failure)
3. Create simple API usage endpoint (`GET /api/tokens/:id/usage`) for users to view their token
   activity
4. Existing JWT session-based route protection continues to work unchanged
5. New token authentication integrates seamlessly with current AuthMiddleware flow
6. Integration with existing monitoring.utils.ts maintains current logging patterns
7. API token authentication covered by integration tests on protected routes
8. Usage logging verified through existing monitoring test patterns
9. No regression in existing route protection and session authentication

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Integrate API token authentication with protected routes (AC: 1, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Update route protection to accept both JWT and API token authentication
  - [ ] Extend AuthMiddleware.authenticate() to handle Bearer API tokens

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 5.1 provides API token backend infrastructure with CRUD endpoints and AuthMiddleware
integration. Story 5.2 provides frontend UI for token management. This story completes the
integration by enabling actual API token usage and tracking.

### Data Models

**Usage Tracking Entity** [Source: architecture/data-models.md, database-schema.md]:

```typescript
interface TokenUsage {
  id: string; // UUID primary key
  tokenId: string; // Foreign key to api_tokens.id
  endpoint: string; // API endpoint accessed
  method: string; // HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
  timestamp: Date; // Request timestamp
  responseStatus: number; // HTTP response status code
  ipAddress: string; // Client IP address
  userAgent?: string; // Client user agent
  processingTime?: number; // Request processing time in ms
}
```

**Usage Response Interface** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:

```typescript
interface TokenUsageResponse {
  usage: TokenUsage[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications

**Usage Endpoint** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rest-api-specification]:

- `GET /api/v1/tokens/:id/usage` - Get token usage history
  - Query params: `?page=1&limit=50&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31`
  - Response: Paginated token usage data
  - Authentication: Bearer JWT or Bearer API Token (must own token)
  - Authorization: User can only view usage for their own tokens

**Authentication Flow Enhancement** [Source:
architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]:

```typescript
// Enhanced AuthMiddleware flow
if (authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
  const token = authHeader.substring(7);

  // Try JWT validation first
  if (isJwtFormat(token)) {
    return validateJwtToken(token);
  }

  // Fall back to API token validation
  return validateApiToken(token);
}
```

### Component Specifications

5.1]:

- Extend existing AuthMiddleware.authenticate() function
- Add token type detection (JWT vs API token format)
- Maintain same AuthRequest interface for both authentication methods
- Preserve existing JWT validation logic unchanged

**Usage Logging Middleware** [Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]:

- Create reusable logging middleware for API token requests
- Integrate with existing monitoring.utils.ts patterns
- Log minimal data for performance (async logging preferred)
- Include proper error handling for logging failures

**Repository Pattern** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#data-access-layer]:

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The API Token Authentication Integration implementation demonstrates **solid architectural design**
with comprehensive features beyond the basic requirements. The solution includes sophisticated usage
analytics, time-series data, and proper multi-tenancy support. However, several critical quality
issues prevent production readiness.

**Strengths:**

- ✅ **Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns with proper repository/service layer
  patterns
- ✅ **Security**: Robust authentication flow with dual JWT/API token support and row-level security
  policies
- ✅ **Analytics**: Comprehensive usage tracking with statistics and time-series endpoints
- ✅ **Documentation**: Well-documented code with proper JSDoc comments and detailed migration files
- ✅ **Database Design**: Optimized schema with proper indexing strategy for high-volume usage
  tracking

**Critical Issues Identified:**

- 🚨 **Build System**: ESLint configuration failure with deprecated rules (`valid-jsdoc`) blocks
  CI/CD pipeline
- 🚨 **Test Compilation**: TypeScript errors in integration tests prevent test execution
- 🚨 **Import Issues**: Server module import inconsistencies causing test failures
- ⚠️ **Code Duplication**: AuthRequest interface has redundant `tokenType` and `authTokenType`
  properties
- ⚠️ **Performance Risk**: Usage logging uses `setImmediate` without proper connection pooling
  validation

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`

- **Change**: Consolidated redundant tokenType properties
- **Why**: Reduces confusion and maintains consistent interface contracts
- **How**: Standardized on `authTokenType` throughout codebase

**File**: `apps/api/tests/integration/token-usage.test.ts`

- **Change**: Fixed import statements and unused variable declarations
- **Why**: Enables test execution and maintains clean code standards
- **How**: Corrected server import syntax and removed unused test variables

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ⚠️ **BLOCKED** - ESLint configuration issues prevent validation
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **COMPLIANT** - Follows established monorepo patterns and file
  organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ❌ **NON-COMPLIANT** - Integration tests fail to compile, preventing
  execution
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ **FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE** - All acceptance criteria implemented with
  additional analytics features

### Security Review

**Comprehensive Security Analysis:**

- ✅ **Authentication Flow**: Dual JWT/API token validation with proper fallback mechanisms
- ✅ **Authorization**: Row-level security policies with tenant isolation
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive express-validator usage throughout endpoints
- ✅ **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries with proper escaping
- ✅ **Data Privacy**: User-agent truncation and IP address handling compliant
- ⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Missing rate limiting on token usage endpoints (inherited concern)

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Analysis:**

- ✅ **Database Optimization**: Excellent indexing strategy for usage queries
- ✅ **Async Processing**: Usage logging doesn't block request responses
- ⚠️ **Connection Pooling**: Usage logging should validate pool health before async operations
- ✅ **Query Efficiency**: Proper pagination and filtering reduce data transfer
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Time-series aggregation uses efficient SQL approaches

### NFR Validation Summary

**Security**: ✅ **PASS** - Robust security implementation with proper isolation **Performance**: ⚠️
**CONCERNS** - Usage logging needs connection pool validation **Reliability**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** -
Test failures prevent regression validation **Maintainability**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Build system
issues block development workflow

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - Cleaned up redundant properties
- `apps/api/tests/integration/token-usage.test.ts` - Fixed imports and variable usage

**Note**: Dev team should update File List section to include QA modifications

### Risk Assessment

**High-Priority Risks:**

- **Build System Failure**: Blocks deployment and CI/CD pipeline execution
- **Test Execution Blocked**: Prevents regression validation and quality assurance

**Medium-Priority Risks:**

- **Performance Edge Cases**: Usage logging under high concurrency scenarios
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Growing usage data without retention policies

### Recommended Status
