# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Analysis Source

**IDE-based fresh analysis** with existing project documentation available

## Existing Project Overview

### Current Project State

NodeAngularFullStack is a production-ready full-stack TypeScript monorepo application implementing a
containerized architecture with Angular 20+ frontend and Express.js backend. The project currently
includes:

- **Primary Purpose**: Modern full-stack boilerplate providing comprehensive foundation for rapid
  application development
- **Core Features**: JWT authentication, role-based access control (Admin/User/ReadOnly), PostgreSQL
  database with multi-tenancy support, configurable tools system
- **Tools Ecosystem**: The application includes a pluggable "tools" feature where users can access
  various utility applications (SVG Drawing, Calendar, Map, Markdown Editor, Short Links, Todo App)
- **Deployment**: Docker-based containerization with Digital Ocean App Platform for production,
  development environment with hot-reload

## Available Documentation Analysis

### Available Documentation

✅ **Tech Stack Documentation** - Complete architecture document with technology stack table ✅
**Source Tree/Architecture** - Monorepo structure documented with apps/ and packages/ organization
✅ **API Documentation** - Express.js routes with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation ✅ **Coding
Standards** - TypeScript strict mode, ESLint + Prettier configuration ✅ **Database Schema** -
PostgreSQL schema with user management, authentication, and tools tables ⚠️ **UX/UI Guidelines** -
Partial (PrimeNG + Tailwind CSS patterns established in existing tools)

**Documentation Quality**: Project has comprehensive technical documentation from greenfield
development. Architecture document (v1.0) provides complete tech stack, deployment infrastructure,
and design patterns.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type

✅ **New Feature Addition** - Adding Form Builder and Form Renderer as new tool in existing tools
ecosystem

### Enhancement Description

Add a drag-and-drop Form Builder tool that allows users to create custom forms with a visual editor,
save form schemas to the database, publish forms with secure tokenized URLs, and render those forms
dynamically for end-users to fill out. This enhancement integrates into the existing "tools" feature
alongside SVG Drawing, Calendar, and other utilities.

### Impact Assessment

✅ **Moderate Impact** - Some existing code changes required

**Integration Points:**

- Tools listing and management (existing tools.routes.ts and ToolsService)
- Database schema extension (new tables for forms, form schemas, and submissions)
- Angular tools components directory pattern (following svg-drawing/ structure)
- Authentication and authorization (existing JWT + role-based access)
- API routing pattern (following existing RESTful conventions)

**Affected Areas:**

- Frontend: New tool component in `/apps/web/src/app/features/tools/components/form-builder/`
- Backend: New API routes in `/apps/api/src/routes/forms.routes.ts`
- Database: New migrations for forms-related tables
- Shared: New TypeScript interfaces for form schemas in `/packages/shared/`

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to create custom forms using drag-and-drop interface without writing code
- Provide secure, tokenized form sharing with expiration support
- Capture form submissions with proper validation and data storage
- Integrate seamlessly with existing tools ecosystem and design patterns
- Support conditional field visibility and advanced form logic
- Maintain production-grade security with rate limiting and token validation

### Background Context

The NodeAngularFullStack application currently provides various productivity tools (SVG Drawing,
Calendar, Todo App, etc.) accessible to authenticated users. Users have requested the ability to
create custom forms for surveys, data collection, event registration, and feedback gathering without
requiring developer intervention.

This enhancement fills a critical gap in the tools ecosystem by providing dynamic form creation
capabilities. The Form Builder will follow the established patterns of existing tools (component
structure, API design, database integration) while introducing new capabilities around schema-based
form rendering, secure public access via tokens, and submission management.
