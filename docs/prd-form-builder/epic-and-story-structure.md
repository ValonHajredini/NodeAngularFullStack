# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Comprehensive Epic** with 10 logically sequenced stories

**Rationale**: The Form Builder and Form Renderer are tightly coupled features that deliver value as
a cohesive unit. Splitting into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries and complicate
dependencies between database schema, API routes, and frontend components. A single epic ensures
proper sequencing from foundation (shared types, database) through backend API, frontend builder
interface, publishing workflow, and finally the public renderer. This approach minimizes integration
risk while maintaining story-level atomicity for testing and rollback.

**Story Sequencing Strategy**: Bottom-up implementation starting with data layer (shared types,
database schema, repositories) → API layer (CRUD operations, publishing) → Frontend builder
(component structure, drag-drop UI) → Publishing workflow (token generation, expiration) → Public
renderer (dynamic forms, submissions) → Security hardening and testing.
